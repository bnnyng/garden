From [[foundations-of-intelligence-in-natural-and-artificial-systems]]:
>The key idea is that we have the ability to transform propositional knowledge into automatic, goal-directed responses (i.e., “intelligent reflexes”). These reflexes are governed by a control policy which maps states of the body to motor commands in a manner conducive to accomplishing particular goals.

Humans can build a collection of useful control policies that can be activated in specific circumstances without [[System 1 and System 2 thinking, after Kahneman|effortful thinking]] (see: [[Intelligence is the capacity to choose between different available heuristics, after Dennett]]).
