Knowledge-level theories are about what an intelligent system is doing and why. This includes questions like:
- What are the goals of the system?
- What are the inputs and outputs?
- How do we understand the systemâ€™s representational mapping? ([[Representation is describing some aspect of reality with a useful symbol]])
