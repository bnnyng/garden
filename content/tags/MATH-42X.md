>[!example] Definition: $\sigma$-algebra
>Given a set $X$, a $\sigma$-algebra is a collection $\mathcal A$ of subsets of $X$ with the following properties:
>- (i) The empty set $\emptyset$ is contained in $\mathcal A$;
>- (ii) For all subsets in $\mathcal A$, their complements in $X$ are also contained in $\mathcal A$;
>- (iii) The union of a countable collection of sets in $\mathcal A$ is also contained in $\mathcal A$.
