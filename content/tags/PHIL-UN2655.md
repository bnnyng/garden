# Overview

*Columbia University, Fall 2024 – Brendan Fleig-Goldstein*

>[!example] Course description
>An overview of the rise of cognitive science as an interdisciplinary field, and the fundamental
debates it has engendered. Cognitive science emerged in the twentieth century as a paradigm for studying the mind. Since its beginning, cognitive science has drawn upon formal developments in philosophy, logic, mathematics, and computer science in order to establish various frameworks for generating and testing theories of cognition. It has sought to integrate, as well as further, the empirical findings of psychology, linguistics, anthropology, and neuroscience. The premises behind this ambitious approach have given rise to significant philosophical discussion. The first half of the course will introduce students to philosophical and empirical developments within the individual disciplines related to cognitive science and will show how they interrelate. The second half of the course is devoted to the central debates: classical computationalism versus connectionism; nativism versus empiricism; representationalism versus anti-representationalism; bottom-up versus top-down approaches; the rationality wars; and so on.

# Final assignment

- [[20241012-cogphil-final-essay-proposal|Cognitive Science and Philosophy final assignment proposal]]

>**(1,000 words)** Submit a complete introduction section as well as a complete outline for the Final Assignment. Your outline should specify clearly the claim you wish to argue for, as well as what your preliminary argument for that claim will be. **5 points.**

>**(2,000 words)** Building on the intro and outline previously submitted, submit a draft of the Final Assignment. This draft need not be a complete paper, but it cannot consist solely of a background section; you must begin to make your actual argument in this draft, even if it is not complete. You are encouraged to focus mainly on developing your argument for this draft. **5 points.**
