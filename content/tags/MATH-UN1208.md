# Overview

*Columbia University, Spring 2023* – *Mike Miller Eismeier* – [Syllabus](https://math.columbia.edu/~mmiller/syllabus-B.pdf) 

>[!example] Course description
>Honors Math B is a course in calculus. Our goal is to cover (much of) the content of Calculus I-IV from a rigorous lens, with the multivariable parts guided by linear algebra. Precisely, we will cover:
>- The real numbers.
>- Continuous and differentiable functions on R and their basic properties, as well as the generalization of continuity and differentiation to multivariable functions, using ideas from linear algebra.
>- Structural results about differentiable functions, such as the inverse function theorem and Clairaut’s theorem.
>- Taylor series for single and multivariable functions.
>- Integration of single and multivariable functions.
>- Manifolds (things like curves and surfaces) and their tangent spaces.
>- Maximization of single and multivariable functions, including with respect to constraints (Lagrange multipliers).
>- The fundamental theorem of calculus and its higher-dimensional generalization to Stokes’ theorem.
