>[!example] Definition: Open map
>A map $f: X \to Y$ between [[Topological spaces and open sets|topological spaces]] $X, Y$ is called an **open map** if for every open subset $U \subseteq X$, the image $f(U)$ is open in $Y$.

>[!example] Definition: Projection maps
>Let $\pi_1 : X \times Y \to X$ and $\pi_2 : X \times Y \to Y$ be defined by the equations
>$$
>\pi_1(x, y) = x \quad \text{and} \quad \pi_2(x, y) = y.
>$$ 
>The maps $\pi_1, \pi_2$ are called the **projections** of $X \times Y$ onto its first and second factors, respectively.

To do:
- [ ] Projection map $\pi_i : X \times Y \to X$ and $\pi_2 : X \times Y \to Y$
	- “Whatever topology you define, projection maps had better be open”
	- Coordinate function
- [ ] Inclusion function
- [ ] Example objects used in topology, example topologies
	- $\mathbb R^\omega$
- [ ] Get examples of eveyrthing listed in lecture
- [ ] Neighborhoods?
- [ ] HW2 results: cts fns preserve limits
- [ ] HW3.1 the embeddings question
- [ ] EVT for [[Compactness]]

Additional notecards:
- To check topology is discrete, suffices to show every singleton is open (make its own note)
- What does an element of the product topology subbasis look like
	- What is the basis for the product/box topology
- [[The countably infinite product of the real line with itself]]
- Finish proof that [[(Theorem) The countable product of the real line is metrizable]]
