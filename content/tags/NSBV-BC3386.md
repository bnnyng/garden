# Overview

*Barnard College, Fall 2024 â€“ Gabrielle Gutierrez*

>[!example] Course description
>Neuroscientists have long been puzzled by how to interpret the various signals that can be measured from the brain. The study of the biological underpinnings of the brain leave these questions open, leading neuroscientists to turn to quantitative methods. This course is about exploring the connection between the neurobiology of the brain and the complex processes it is capable of. Through an examination of sensory systems, neural and synaptic mechanisms that allow the brain to adapt, and neural architectures that support the processing of information, we will get a broad view of how neuroscientists understand The Neural Code.

>By the end of this course you'll understand some of the canonical principles underlying how brains encode information. You'll become familiar with the most influential frameworks and models for describing the encoding and transfer of information in the brain and you'll dive into the origins of these coding frameworks. Our objectives are to:
>- Identify, compare, and critique the different frameworks that are used to measure, quantify, and model the signals generated by the brain.
>- Interpret and evaluate scientific journal articles that describe computational and theoretical models of neural coding.
>- Integrate methods of resourcefulness and collaboration to achieve a high-level understanding of the course material.
