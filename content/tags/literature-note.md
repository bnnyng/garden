Literature notes correspond with a single source (book, article, video, etc.). They will generally be formatted with the following sections:
- *Summary* – a paragraph to capture the main ideas from the text in an informational way, in the same vein as a scientific abstract. There may also be a link to a private “raw” note that stores bibliographic data and all my direct highlights.
- *Takeaways* – distinct from a summary, these are points that I want to apply directly to my life or thinking.
- *Key terms* – context-dependent definitions, often lifted directly from the source material. These may be linked to “definition” (permanent) notes that contain a slightly different operational definition, or link several variant definitions of the same term.
- *Notes* – bulleted, complete sentences that paraphrase the source. Significant or interesting points will be converted to atomic [permanent notes](https://by2328.github.io/garden/tags/permanent-note).
	- Subheadings reflect subsections of the source material, whether explicitly or implicitly divided.
	- Direct quotes I find particularly interesting or informative may be copied over, but the bulk of text should be my own writing.
	- I will also write down questions, ephemeral observations, and possible connections to other permanent notes.

Making a literature note is my way of “processing” raw source material. The goal of processing is to incorporate what I read into my existing knowledge base in a concrete way. Ideally, processing is done at least one day after finishing the original source.
