Permanent notes are a sort of catch-all for any information I want to preserve that is not my original thinking (though the line is sometimes pretty fuzzy!). My notion of permanent notes is heavily inspired by Andy Matuschak’s [evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes). 

Most permanent notes are “atomic” concepts (these are always titled with a complete proposition). Other types of permanent notes include:
- Stubs defined implicitly through backlinks;
- “[Content maps](https://by2328.github.io/garden/tags/moc),” typically created out of stubs, that contain a brief summary and primarily serve as a table of contents for other notes (e.g., [§ Linear algebra](https://by2328.github.io/garden/%C2%A7-Linear-algebra));
- “Definition” notes for technical terms or terms of art, which are different from topic notes in that they contain complete sentence descriptions (e.g., [Dynamic coupling](https://by2328.github.io/garden/Dynamic-coupling), [The contemplative life](https://by2328.github.io/garden/The-contemplative-life));
- “Bridge” notes which capture similarities and differences between two concepts;
- Other proper nouns, such as “person” notes, which are not concept-oriented.
