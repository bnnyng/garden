# Overview

*Columbia University, Fall 2024 – Peter Woit* – [Course website](https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/QM/fall2024.html)

>[!example] Course description
>This course will be an introduction to the subject of quantum mechanics, from a perspective emphasizing the role of Lie groups and their representations.  Most of the standard material and examples from a conventional first physics course on the subject will be covered, but with much greater attention to the mathematical ideas behind the standard formalism and usual calculational techniques.
