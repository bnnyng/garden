The “symbol grounding problem” is the problem of how biological and artificial cognitive systems use internal formal symbols to refer to things in the real world.

The symbol grounding problem has inspired a converse: [[The symbol ungrounding problem asks how literal meanings are abstracted into arbitrary symbols]].

There are two ways to frame the symbol grounding problem: mental content externalism and sensorimotor grounding. The latter is closer to the problem’s original framing.

The “mental content externalism” perspective is that the relationships between physical and semantic components in the cognitive [[Information-processing systems are understood at knowledge, algorithm, and physical implementation levels|levels of explanation]] are arbitrary; brain and body characteristics may constrain what actions are performed, but there is nothing deterministic in the relationship between physical characteristics and mental [[Representation is describing some aspect of reality with a useful symbol|representations]]. Rather, the relationships are determined by the agent’s [[Embodied cognition|situatedness]]. Thus, [[Embodied cognition]] presents an answer to the symbol grounding problem.

From [[embodied-situated-and-grounded-intelligence]]:
>On this view, nothing in the brain is sufficient to fix the meaning of a mental symbol. While the brain constrains meaning, the history and environment of an animal \[are] also necessary to fix the meaning of its mental symbols.

>Analogously, the physical properties of one part of a mechanism (e.g., a gear) are not sufficient to fix its function within the mechanism. These properties constrain the functions it might perform, but the part doesn’t have any determinate function outside the context of a specific mechanism, since many mechanisms use the same parts for different purposes.

The “sensorimotor grounding” perspective focuses on how the specific cognitive architecture relates mental [[Representation is describing some aspect of reality with a useful symbol|representations]] to things in the world.

[[Different accounts of the symbol grounding problem give different importance to embodiment in ongoing cognition]].
