[[2020-dutilh-novaes-dialogical-roots-of-deduction|Dutilh Novaes (2020)]] defines deductive dialogues as **Prover-Skeptic games.** The requirements for a Skeptic to be persuaded by a proof depend on context, but include, minimally:

- **Not having counterexamples.**
- **Being convinced by each step of the argument.** See the requirement that deductive arguments have [[Three main features of deductive arguments, after Dutilh Novaes|stepwise perspicuity]].
