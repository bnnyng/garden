>Given a [[Bases and dimension|basis]] for a [[Axioms for fields and vector spaces|vector space]] $\{v_1, \cdots, v_n\} \subset V$ and a list of vectors $(w_1, \cdots, w_n) \subset W$, there exists a unique [[Linear maps|linear map]] $A : V \to W$ for which $Av_i = w_i$ for all $1 \leq i \leq n$. 

The key takeaway from this theorem is that to show two maps $A,B : V \to W$ are equal, we only need to check if $Av_i = Bv_i$ on some basis of $V$.
