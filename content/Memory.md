[[The three stages of memory]] are sensory memory, short-term or working memory, and long-term memory.

There are many ways to categorize memory. [[Squire's taxonomy of long-term memory]] distinguishes between **declarative memory**, which concerns facts and events, and **non-declarative memory**, which includes procedural memory, priming and perceptual learning, classical conditioning, and non-associative learning.

[[Memory consolidation]] helps eliminate the burden of storing large amounts of perceptual data in long-term memory.
