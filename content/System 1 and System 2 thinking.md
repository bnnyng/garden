Humans are capable of two “systems” of thinking, “automatic” System 1 cognition and “effortful” System 2 cognition. Distinguishing the two systems is the main thesis of *Thinking, Fast and Slow* by Daniel Kahneman; however, the specific line between them remains controversial. System 1 and System 2 may also refer to two types of cognitive tasks.

| System 1 | System 2 |
| ---- | ---- |
| Fast, intuitive, habitual | Slow, logical, planned |
| Implicit knowledge | Explicit knowledge |
| Unconscious, cannot be reported | Conscious, linguistic |
| 1-step parallel | Sequential, algorithmic |
| Demonstrated by current [[§ Deep learning\|deep learning]] models | Demonstrated by agents with [[Generalization\|generalized]] ability, like humans |

Yoshua Bengio believes that System 2 supports System 1 thinking by adding to a set of “intelligent reflexes.” This suggests that implementing System 2 thinking in neural networks may lead to advances in machine intelligence.
