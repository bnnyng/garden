Humans are capable of two “systems” of thinking, “automatic” System-1 cognition and “effortful” System 2 cognition. The distinction between the two systems is controversial and hard to draw.

System 1 thinking includes fast processes like perception and quick heuristics for solving problems. 

System 2 thinking is slow, sequential, and rule-based. System 2 thinking may enable humans to generalize knowledge to different domains and acquire knowledge without proportional amounts of data. This knowledge supports System 1 thinking by adding to a set of “intelligent reflexes.”

AI agents are excellent at System 1-style tasks. This suggests that implementing System 2 thinking in neural networks may lead to advances in machine intelligence.
