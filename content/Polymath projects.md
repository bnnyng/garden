# Literature review

##### Gowers & Nielson (2009) – “Massively Collaborative Mathematics”

- **Memory and collective intelligence:** “The blogs and wiki functioned as a collective short-term working memory, a conversational commons for the rapid-fire exchange and improvement of ideas.”
- **Numerical data:** “Over the next 37 days, 27 people contributed approximately 800 substantive comments, containing 170,000 words.”
- **Barriers to entry and lessons for scaling up:** “A significant barrier to entry was the linear narrative style of the blog. This made it difficult for late entrants to identify problems to which their talents could be applied. There was also a natural fear that they might have missed an earlier discussion and that any contribution they made would be redundant.”

##### Kloumann et al., (2016) – Comparing research vs. Olympiad problems in Polymath
- Main findings
	- **Authors and leadership:** Polymaths had higher contribution from fewer people
	- **Temporal dynamics:** Polymaths had shorter time scales, more rapid-fire clusters
	- **Linguistic properties**: Polymaths had higher word distinctiveness, greater politeness, greater relevance to original post, greater usage of past tense
- Linguistic features – divided into relevance, distinctiveness, politeness, and generality
- Identifying highlights – can research highlights characterized as milestones when something unfolds, or only realized in retrospect?

> - Research breakthroughs are noted in the wikis – can these be mapped to moments of exploration and exploitation? 
> 	- Use Polymath1 as a case study
> - How do temporal dynamics and response times relate to moments of diversity?
> - Do high-level linguistic properties have effects on trajectory of discussion or quality of outcome?

##### Pease et al. (2019) – Close content analysis to identify which types of explanations occur in informal Polymath conversations

- Explanation-indicator approach to each comment, multiple can apply
	- Mathematical contexts: initial problem, proof, assertion, example, argument, representation, property
	- Purposive elements: abilities, understanding, knowledge, values
- .

> - The type of cognitive move “extraction” we are interested in requires high domain expertise and manual analysis – could possibly extend with the computational methods from “rhetorical analysis” paper, but would depend on existing taxonomies
