>[!example] Definition: Product topology
> Given [[Topological spaces and open sets|topological spaces]] $(X, \mathcal T_X)$ and $(Y, \mathcal T_Y)$, the **product topology** on $X \times Y$ is generated by the [[Basis for a topology|basis]]
> $$
> \mathcal B = \{ U \times V \ | \ U \in \mathcal T_X, \ V \in \mathcal T_Y \}.

Note that general **open sets** in $X \times Y$ are *not* of the form $U \times V$, because $\mathcal B$ is not closed under unions‚Äîthat is, open sets are all unions of sets of the form $U \times V$. 

The following result defines the product topology when $X,Y$ are specified by their bases.

>[!abstract] Theorem (Munkres 15.1): Product topology specified by bases

>is a basis for the **product topology** on $X \times Y$.

# Product topologies and subspaces

>[!abstract] Theorem: Two ways of defining subspace products
>If $A$ is a [[Subspace (induced) topology|subspace]] of $X$ and $B$ is a subspace of $Y$, then the product topology on $A \times B$ is the same as the topology $A \times B$ *inherits* as a subspace of $X \times Y$.

## Definitions

- Product topology

## Exercises

- Check that the basis for the **product topology** is indeed a basis.‚≠ê
- Is the basis defined in the product topology itself a topology? Why or why not?
- Prove the theorem for a product topology specified by bases. (Hint: use [[(Lemma) Obtaining a basis from a topology]].) ‚≠ê
- Prove that the two ways of defining subspace products are equivalent.
