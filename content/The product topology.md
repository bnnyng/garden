# Overview

There are two natural ways that [[Topological spaces and open sets|topologies]] may be generated by a [[Topological bases and subbases|basis]] for a general, possibly infinite Cartesian product $\prod X_\alpha$:
- The **box topology** has as a basis all sets of the form $\prod U_\alpha$, where $U_\alpha \subseteq X_\alpha$ is an open subset for each index $\alpha$.
- The **product topology** has as *subbasis* all sets of the form $\pi_\alpha^{-1}(U_\alpha)$ for some open subset $U_\alpha \subseteq X_\alpha$. This generates a basis containing all sets of the form $\prod U_\alpha$, where $U_\alpha = X_\alpha$ exactly except for *finitely* many values of $\alpha$. 

In general, the box topology is [[Topological spaces and open sets|finer]] than the product topology; they are exactly the same for finite products $\prod_{\alpha=1}^n X_\alpha$. *When considering a general product space, assume the product topology unless otherwise specified.*

# The product topology on $X \times Y$

>[!example] Definition: Product topology on the Cartesian product $X \times Y$
> Given [[Topological spaces and open sets|topological spaces]] $(X, \mathcal T_X)$ and $(Y, \mathcal T_Y)$, the **product topology** on their Cartesian product $X \times Y$ is generated by the [[Topological bases and subbases|basis]]
> $$
> \mathcal B = \{ U \times V \ | \ U \in \mathcal T_X, \ V \in \mathcal T_Y \}.
> $$

Note that general **open sets** in $X \times Y$ are *not* of the form $U \times V$, because $\mathcal B$ is not closed under unions‚Äîthat is, open sets are all unions of sets of the form $U \times V$. 

The following result defines the product topology when $X,Y$ are specified by their bases.

>[!abstract] Theorem (Munkres 15.1): Product topology specified by bases
>If $\mathcal B$ is a [[Topological bases and subbases|basis]] for the [[Topological spaces and open sets|topology]] of $X$ and $\mathcal C$ is a basis for the topology of $Y$, then the collection

>\mathcal D = \{ B \times C \ | \ B \in \mathcal B, \ C \in \mathcal C \}
>$$
>is a basis for the **product topology** on $X \times Y$.

## Product topologies and subspaces

>[!abstract] Theorem: Two ways of defining subspace products on $X \times Y$
>If $A$ is a [[Subspace (induced) topology|subspace]] of $X$ and $B$ is a subspace of $Y$, then the product topology on $A \times B$ is the same as the topology $A \times B$ *inherits* as a subspace of $X \times Y$.

# Generalized products

 >[!example] Terminology: Tuple notation for arbitrary indexing sets
>Let $J$ be an indexing set. Given any set $X$, we define a **$J$-tuple** of elements of $X$ as a *function* $\mathbf x : J \to X$. The function $\mathbf x$ is often denoted by the quasi-tuple notation
>$$
>(x_\alpha)_{\alpha \in J}.
>$$ 
>For each index $\alpha \in J$, the **$\alpha$-coordinate of $\mathbf x$** is the value of the tuple at $\mathcal \alpha$, and often denoted $x_\alpha$ rather than its technical definition $\mathbf x (\alpha)$.

>[!example] Definition: Generalized Cartesian product
>Given an indexed family of sets $\{X_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in J}$, the **(generalized) Cartesian product** 
>$$
>\prod_{\alpha \in J} X_\alpha
>$$
>is the family of all *functions* $\mathbf x : J \to \bigcup_{\alpha \in J}X_\alpha$ such that, for all  $\alpha \in J$, we get an element $\mathbf x (\alpha) \in X_\alpha$. 
>
>In other words, the Cartesian product is the set of all $J$-tuples $(x_\alpha)_{\alpha \in J}$ of elements of the *union* of $\{X_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in J}$, where for all $\alpha \in J$, the $\alpha$-coordinate $x_\alpha$ is an element of the set $X_\alpha$.

We can also phrase the notion of coordinates in terms of projection maps. Let $\mathbf x \in \prod_{\alpha \in J} X_\alpha$ be some function in the product. Then the $\beta$-coordinate of $\mathbf x$ for some $\beta \in J$ corresponds to an element $\mathbf x (\beta)$ in the set $X_\beta$, which is precisely the projection $\pi_\beta : \prod_{\alpha \in J} X_\alpha \to X_\beta$ that maps a function to an element by $\mathbf x \mapsto \mathbf x (\beta)$.

# Box and product topologies

>Suppose each set in the indexed family $\{X_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in J}$ is a [[Topological spaces and open sets|topological space]]. 
>- The **box topology** on $\prod_{\alpha \in J} X_\alpha$ is the topology generated by the [[Topological bases and subbases|basis]] $\prod_{\alpha \in J} U_\alpha$, where each $U_\alpha$ is open in $X_\alpha$.
>- The **product topology** on $\prod_{\alpha \in J} X_\alpha$  is the topology generated by the subbasis
>$$
>\bigcup_{\alpha \in J} \{ \pi^{-1}(U) \ | \ U \text{ open in } X_\alpha \},
>$$
>which gives the basis
>$$
>\left\{ \prod_{\alpha \in J} U_\alpha \ | \ U_\alpha = X_\alpha \text{ for all but finitely many } \alpha \in J \right\}.

# Examples

#### Continuity in the box topology vs. in the metric topology

Let $\mathbb R^\omega$ be [[The countably infinite product of the real line with itself]]. This is an example of when [[(Theorem) Continuity of maps relative to the product topology]] fails for the **box topology.**

Define a map to the product $f: \mathbb R \to \mathbb R^\omega$ by 
$$
f(x) = (x, x, x, ...),
$$
so each coordinate function $f_n(x) = x$ is continuous, and thus, $f$ is continuous relative to the product topology. On the other hand, take the [[Topological bases and subbases|basic open set]] 
$$
B = (-1, 1) \times \left(-\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2} \right) \times \left(-\frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{3} \right) \times \cdots = \prod_{n \geq 1}\left(-\frac{1}{n}, \frac{1}{n} \right)
$$
for the box topology. $B$ is clearly open in $\mathbb R^\omega$, but $f^{-1}(B)$ is not open in $\mathbb R$: we have $0 \in f^{-1}B$, but there exists no $(-\epsilon, \epsilon)$ that is smaller than $(-1/n, 1/n)$ for all $n$. #concept-question

# Review

- Check that the basis for the **product topology** is indeed a basis. (Hint: is the intersection of basis elements also a basis element?)‚≠ê
- Is the basis defined in the product topology itself a topology? Why or why not?
- Prove the theorem for a product topology specified by bases. (Hint: use [[(Lemma) Obtaining a basis from a topology]].) ‚≠ê 
- Prove that the two ways of defining subspace products are equivalent.
- Check that the basis generating the **box topology** is indeed a basis.
- What is the difference between the bases for the box and product topologies? Specifically, for each basis element $\prod_{\alpha \in J} U_\alpha$, what is $U_\alpha$ representing? (See Munkres Theorem 19.1). ‚≠ê
- Show that if $J$ is infinite, then the box, uniform, and product topologies are distinct (i.e., strict inclusions). ‚≠ê
- Suppose $X_i = \{ 0, 1\}$ has the discrete topology for $i \in \mathbb Z_{>0}$. Convince yourself that $\prod_{i=1}^\infty X_i$ is discrete in the box topology, but not in the product topology (in fact, in the product topology, this is isomorphic to the Cantor set). ‚≠ê
- Give an example of when Theorem 19.6 fails for the box topology.

# Notes

There are two natural ways that a topology arises for a general, possibly infinite Cartesian products
$$
X_1 \times \cdots \times X_n \quad \quad \quad 
X_1 \times X_2 \times \cdots
$$
where each $X_i$ is a [[Topological spaces and open sets|topological space]]. One strategy, is to take as a [[Topological bases and subbases|basis]] the products of open sets $U_i \subset X_i$, while another is to take as a *subbasis* all sets of the form $\pi_i^{-1}(U_i)$, which generates basis elements that are *finite* intersections. In particular, for the second strategy, each tuple $\mathbf x$ is in a basis element 
$$
B = \pi_\alpha^{-1}(U_1) \cap \pi_\beta^{-1}(U_2) \cap \cdots
$$
if and only if $\pi_i(\mathbf x) \in U_i$ for whatever indices $i$ are present in the intersection. For a finite product, these strategies are equivalent; for an infinite

- Other reasons the product topology is more important:
	- **Coarsest topology such that the projection maps are continuous‚Äîpreimage is the basic open set**
	- We want finite intersections because the idea of openness has something to do with a neighborhood?
