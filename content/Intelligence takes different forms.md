- Mirta Galesic (Santa Fe Institute)
	- Human-centered definitions of intelligence to account for when animals outperform humans on cognitive tasks; “we need a better notion of intelligence to properly appreciate the distinctive cognitive abilities of diverse agents.”
	- A better model is **ecological rationality**, the degree to which an agent’s cognitive “toolbox” is adapted to its environment.
		- See: [[Intelligence is the capacity to choose between different available heuristics, after Dennett]]
- Melanie Moses (University of New Mexico, Santa Fe Institute)
	- Biological intelligence aims to use environmental maps to increase one’s fitness, and is able to change the world to make those maps more “valuable”; “biological general intelligence” means having many maps of the world, or maps that remain useful across diverse environments.
	- Human intelligence includes the unique capacity for “understanding, meta-cognition, and a heightened ability to teach and learn”; [[Human cognition models both the world and our own minds, after Hofstadter]]
	- Collective intelligences are able to balance [[Exploration-exploitation tradeoff]] by distributing objectives among individual members, organize into systems, and react to their own organization.
		- [[Cooperation is driven by difficulty in distinguishing between self and others]]

- Doesn’t the notion of “intelligence is a fit between a cognitive system and its environment” suggest that ML algorithms are highly intelligent for their given environments? This is not a satisfying judgement; we want something human-like in general when we talk about intelligence. Therefore, to me, this definition is unconvincing.
