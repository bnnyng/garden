Melanie Moses (University of New Mexico, Santa Fe Institute) divides intelligence into three forms:
- Biological intelligence aims to use environmental maps to increase one’s fitness, and is able to change the world to make those maps more “valuable”; “biological general intelligence” means having many maps of the world, or maps that remain useful across diverse environments.
- Human intelligence includes the unique capacity for “understanding, meta-cognition, and a heightened ability to teach and learn”; [[Human cognition models both the world and our own minds, after Hofstadter]]
- Collective intelligences are able to balance [[Exploration-exploitation tradeoff]] by distributing objectives among individual members, organize into systems, and react to their own organization.
	- [[Cooperation is driven by difficulty in distinguishing between self and others]]
