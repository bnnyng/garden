The “symbol ungrounding problem” is about how humans are capable of abstracting away from literal concepts and refer to them using analogy and figurative language (e.g., metaphor, idioms).

> If the meanings of symbols (including words) are firmly grounded in our sensory-motor systems, what explains our facility with uses of symbols that run roughshod over their normal sensory-motor associations (e.g., reasoning about the actions of an international “body” of scientists or the social consequences of a “family” of emerging technologies)?

One solution is the theory that [[Language is an embodied neuroenhancement and scaffold, after Dove]].
