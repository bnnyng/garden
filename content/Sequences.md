# Overview

A sequence is a function whose domain is the natural numbers. Sequences can diverge (e.g., $x_n = n$), converge (e.g., $x_n = 1/n$), or oscillate (e.g., $x_n = (-1)^n$).

A **convergent sequence** has a **limit** $x$ such that the values $x_n$ can be made arbitrarily close to $x$ for large values of $n \in \mathbb N$. Every convergent sequence is also [[Cauchy sequences|Cauchy]].

## Sequences and subsequences

>[!example] Definition: Sequence in a metric space
>Given a [[Metrics, metric spaces, and the metric topology|metric space]] $(X, d)$, a **sequence**, often denoted $(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb N}$, is a discrete function $\mathbb N \to \mathbb X$ which maps each natural number $n$ to a real value $x_n$.

>[!example] Definition: Subsequence
>If $(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb N}$ is a sequence and $(n_k) \in \mathbb N$ is a sequence of natural numbers with $n_{k+1} > n_k$, then $(x')_k = x_{n_k}$ is a **subsequence** of $(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb N}$.

## Convergent sequences


>[!example] Definition: Convergent sequence in a metric space
>Given a [[Metrics, metric spaces, and the metric topology|metric space]] $(X, d)$, a sequence $(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb N}$ is called **convergent in $X$** if there exists $x \in X$ such that
>$$
>\forall_{\epsilon> 0} \ \exists_{N \in \mathbb N} \ \forall_{n \in \mathbb N} \ [ n \geq N \implies d(x_n, x )< \epsilon].
>$$
>In this case, we say $x$ is the **limit** of $(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb N}$ and write $\lim_{n \to \infty}x_n = x$. A sequence is **divergent** if it does not converge to some $x$.

# In topological spaces

>[!example] Definition: Convergent sequence in a topological space
>A squence $x_1, x_2, â€¦$ of points in an arbitrary [[Topological spaces and open sets|topological space]] $X$ **converges** to the point $x$ if, for each **neighborhood** $U$ of $x$, there exists a positive integer $N$ such that $x_n \in U$ for all $n \geq N$.

The key difference is that sequences *can converge to more than one point* in an arbitrary space!

# Proof appendix

![[Sequences#^ac6d87]]

*Proof of (i).* 

For all $\epsilon > 0$, exist $N_x, N_y \in \mathbb N$ such that for all $n > N_x$, we have $d(x_n, x) < \epsilon/2$, and similarly for all $n > N_y$. Then for all $n > \text{max}(N_x, N_y)$, we have
$$
d(x, y) \leq d(x_n, x) + d(x_n, y) = \epsilon,
$$
so $d(x, y)= 0$ and $x = y$.

*Proof of (iii).*

Since $(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb N}$ is convergent, for all $\epsilon> 0$, there exists $N \in \mathbb N$ such that $d(x_n, x)< \epsilon/2$ for all $n > N$ and some $x \in X$. By the [[Triangle inequality|triangle inequality]], for all $n, m > N,
$$
d(x_n, x_m) \leq d(x_n, x) + d(x, x_m) < \epsilon,
$$
which is precisely what it means for $(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb N}$ to converge.

# Notes

#### [[MATH-UN1208|Honors Mathematics B]]

- *(Proposition 3.1)* **Continuous functions take convergent sequences to convergent sequences.** If $f: D \to \mathbb R$ is [[Pointwise continuity|continuous]] and $x_n \in D$ is a **convergent sequence** $x_n \to x$ with $x \in D$ as well, then $f$ sends $x_n$ to another convergent sequence $f(x_n) \to f(x)$ .
- *(Proposition 3.2)* **Convergent sequences converge to a *unique* limit**. If $x_n \to x$ and $x_n \to x^\prime$, then $x = x^\prime$.
- *(Lemma 3.3)* **Bounded monotone sequences converge.** Suppose $x_n$ is **monotone increasing**, so $x_n +1 \geq x$ for all $n \in \mathbb N$, and [[Bounded sets and functions|bounded above]], so there exists an $x$ with $x_n \leq x$ for all $n \in \mathbb N$. Then $x_n$ **converges** to some $x^\prime$.
