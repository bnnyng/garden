# Lecture: What is cognitive science?

## What is not cognitive science?

- [[Cognitive science treats the brain as an information-processing system]]
#### Phenomenology
- Phenomenologists (e.g. Sartre, Heidegger) aim to describe personal experience as fully and accurately as possible
- Phenomenology focuses on "introspectable" states of consciousness, rather than using the motor or perceptual system
- The phenomenological explanation breaks whole experience into simple, atomic parts
- Unlike cognitive science, it is simply descriptive and does not explain the mechanism or causation

#### Psychoanalysis
- Psychoanalysts (e.g. Freud) understand the mind by studying and generalizing from pathologies
- Psychoanalysis focuses on the influences of (postulated) unconscious states on beliefs and actions
- Unlike cognitive science, the mechanistic explanation depends on "forces" instead of computation
- The end goal is treatment, not predicting human behavior

#### Behaviorism
- Behaviorists (e.g. Skinner) believe that all behavior is the result of rewards and punishments
- Behaviorism focuses on the mind reduced to observable behavior, with no interest in inner consciousness
- Behavior is explained through elaborate correlations, while the cognitive processes remain a "black box"

#### Phrenology
- Phrenologists assume that specific mental activities and tasks are performed by specific parts of the brain
- Unlike cognitive science, phrenology is not interested in the processes or computations that occur in the brain

#### Pharmacology
- The pharmacological method seeks to affect behavior with chemical interventions
- Pharmacology focuses on narrow behaviors, not general beliefs, with a goal of solving specific illnesses or cognitive malfunctions
- Pharmacology can explain correlations between drugs (chemical processes) and behavior, but is not concerned with how the brain processes information step-by-step

#### Biology
- The biological method uses a cellular explanation of the brain (i.e. how neurons are connected)
- The explanation is mechanistic, but at a more detailed ("lower") level than cogsci, which is a systemic view

## Fundamental concepts of cognitive science

1. Information processes can be studied as operations on patterns or symbols
2. Symbols have **semantic meaning** and represent something real in the world
3. We can partially separate the mental processes (brain circuitry) from their physical implementation (what kind of intormation is being processed)
4. We can uncover abstract, universal principles extending across cultures, species, and to artifical minds

## What makes up cognitive science?
- Psychology - How do individuals and groups behave?
- Philosophy - How should we study mental processes?
- Neuroscience - How does the brain create the mind?
- Computer science - How can we replicate (implement) mental processes?
	- What does this reveal about human processing?
- Lingustics - How is language used to think and communicate?

## Cognitive science research
- Empirical studies of human and animal behavior
- Empirical studies of brains (e.g. imaging)
- Computational modeling (e.g. mathematical simulations)
	- Help reveal fundamental limits of information processing
- Philosophical arguments (e.g. AI vs. humans)

## Big questions in cognitive science
- Where do human minds come from?
	- Evolution?
	- Physical environment (embodied cognition)?
	- Social enviornment? How do people differ?
- What kind of representations does the mind operate on?
	- Major cogsci debate: discrete, symbolic representation (e.g. letters) or continuous patterns of neural activity?
- How can we connect mental processes to neural circuits?
	- Neurons (physical state) are unpredictable, while cognitive processes are generally stable
- How do we transfer thoughts between brains using language?
	- Language transmits information
	- Is there a biological, physical basis for language? Is it just a social technology?
	- How is language learned?
- What information do we select to pay attention to and remember?
	- Metacognition: Do I have enough information? Should I decide to get more information to make a decision?
	- How do w store information into useful formats (memory and retrieval)?
