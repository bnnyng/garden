# Application questions
*Answers are limited to 250 words.*
###### Someone gives you $50,000 for a project that explicitly can’t be a business. What’s the project you work on and why?

I believe knowledge can be partitioned into memory (information lineages that may be encoded at any timescale, e.g., individual neural pathways, cultural norms, species DNA, Plato’s immortal soul) and life experience (entirely incompressible). (Perhaps just a derivative of the exhausted nature-nature debate.) Encoded memory can be distributed and shared; life experience cannot. This relates to constructivism, the pedagogical theory where students learn by actively constructing unique knowledge bases. It follows that evolving something like human intelligence requires embodied life experience.

My project would attempt to evolve intelligent organisms an online world that supports full embodied physics. Counterintuitively, the goal would be for agents to act autonomously from, rather than couple with their environments: a distinguishing feature of human intelligence is the degrees of freedom we have compared to other animals, which have relatively little “agency” over their habitats. I’m inspired by Ted Chiang’s story “The Lifecycle of Software Objects,” in which virtual pets called “digients” begin demonstrating higher intelligence and create all sorts of ethical crises; and Steve Grand’s Creatures game, where users can modify the genetic code of an artificial species. Like Grand, I would take a bottom-up approach of engineering simpler structures and treating complex phenomena like consciousness as emergent. Finally, to address the issue that learning gained by interacting with intelligent entities cannot (yet) be replicated by interacting with non-intelligent entities, this artificial world requires a mechanism for organisms to engage with humans.

The $50,000 would fund computing resources, human “teachers”, and (unemployed) life expenses.

###### Think about your three core interests. Why do you care about these things?

My most time-consuming interest is pure mathematics, since I’m a math major. I can truthfully call this an interest because I am pursuing the degree purely for self-edification; my career goals involve cognitive science research. Mathematics stretches my conceptual abilities like nothing else. Further, mathematical practice, which has no immediate reward besides demonstrating that you care about math, is endlessly fascinating. It is the only intellectually rigorous discipline that will admit that its ground truth is simply what the collective future practitioners agree upon. After Polanyi: “Mathematics cannot be defined without acknowledging its most obvious feature: namely, that it is interesting.”

The apparent uselessness of pure math (half-joking) brings me to another theme of interest: the use of knowledge in daily life. With the immense amount of information we encounter daily, how do we choose to remember anything? What, if anything, is worth knowing for its own sake? I obsessively catalog everything I read in the Obsidian app, treating the linked text files as my extended memory and sandbox for creating conceptual linkages. 

Beyond information storage, I am also interested in information communication. Typical conversations only contain 13 bits of information (i.e., Shannon entropy) per second! This suggests interlocuters must share a model of how the conversation will flow, which also enables us to land backchannels (interjections like nodding, “yeah”) at highly informative points without having any physical means responding to the actual content in time. Some of my research relates to “model-sharing” in collaborative mathematics problem-solving.

###### What’s something you accomplished or created in the last year that you’re proud of?

I completed a Vipassana meditation retreat: 10 hours of meditation a day for 10 days. No speaking, reading, writing, or even making eye contact with other participants. Morning practices starting at 4 a.m. It was one of the most difficult, yet gratifying experiences of my life. 

I was a wrestler, so I am no stranger to pushing my physical limits, but I had never before experienced so much discomfort simply by existing. For the first three days, our meditation hours were entirely dedicated to focusing on the sensation of air moving through the nostrils. 

Each night, we watched an hour-long lecture on Vipassana principles, as well as the technique we would develop in the next day. Ultimately, these principles were what changed me the most. As with many other Buddhist practices, Vipassana teaches that suffering is created by attachment or aversion to any temporary thing. The meditation was an embodied learning of Dhamma, the notion that nothing ever lasts, and a way of physically habituating oneself to a mindset that would otherwise be a fleeting idea.

I was the youngest of my cohort by far, and many others told me they wish they’d started meditation at my age. I’d began during a period of great life uncertainty, and I left with a mind place I can always retreat to in times of distress, a home within myself. I urge everyone to try the retreat if they are interested; the most difficult part is finding the time.

###### What qualities or skills best characterize the way you discover and solve problems?

Bottom-up and data-driven, rather than top-down or theoretically motivated. Because I mainly discover and find ways to answer open questions in scientific research, my response mostly applies to that context. As I am early in any career, I can reasonably assume that any idea I derive from first principles will have been thought of before, so I am somewhat cautious/conservative with those efforts. Instead, I can use others’ discoveries to my advantage, and offer novel perspectives by integrating knowledge across my various fields of interest; unlike most established researchers, I have not yet siloed myself into a particular academic discipline. Thus, my current research lies at the intersection of mathematics and cognitive science (using NLP to characterize collaborative mathematical reasoning; using function learning/teaching tasks to model how individuals may represent audiences’ theories of mind when teaching).

At a more mundane level, this habit also appears when I am solving a math proof. When I do not know how to continue, instead of chewing on the problem statement longer, I begin listing the definition of every object involved and the statement of every related theorem until I can synthesize pieces into a new argument.

###### Please choose one of the following prompts to respond to:  
>(1) Talk about a time a piece of writing, movie, conversation, art project or other life experience changed your mind. How did your perspective change and why?  
>(2) Elaine Scarry: “Beauty comes out to greet us and prepares us for the other undertakings, for finding out about truth and committing ourselves to justice.” Agree or disagree?

I agree with Scarry. To clarify, I take the “greeting” metaphorically; I consider beauty an emergent property of broader consciousness, a bias towards particular aesthetic properties of objects physical or imagined. A teleological understanding of human activity is incomplete without recognizing that beauty is real, in the sense that our aesthetic biases direct our actions (i.e., have a causal effect) in the world.

Though I’m staunchly anti-Platonic about beauty conceptually, Plato is the natural starting point for understanding how aesthetic biases—specifically, the ancient Greek treatment of mathematics—not only enable pursuit of truth, but also determine our causal history. For the Greeks, elucidating the elegant mathematical “laws” of the physical world was imitating their causal God. Simone Weil explains: “\[Geometry’s] purpose was the same as the purpose of their art, namely to make perceptible a kinship between the human mind and the universe.”  

Science, which is pursuit of truth about our physical world, follows this aesthetic tradition. At its core, science relies on principles of beauty to discern structure in the world. Scientific paradigms, or how we “carve nature at its joints,” are adopted as a matter of taste before rigorous evidence is acquired (see Hasok Chang’s work).

At the individual level, beauty prepares us for “other undertakings” because observing the beautiful requires attention (a particularly contentious topic in today’s (over?)stimulating environments!). Pausing to pass an aesthetic judgement gives us a place to stand in our own cognition, to probe our own consciousness in the way no other living beings do. Recognizing beauty, then, enables the rest of human accomplishment and flourishing.
