## Introduction

- Social dilemma similar to coronavirus situation, tragedy of the commons
- Main takeaways
	- If each actor can imagine actions of others, might help us develop empathy and reinforce good behavior?
	- Intrinsic social influence rewards consistently lead to higher collective return
	- Influence reward can lead to emergence of communication protocols
	- Influence can be achieved by giving models an *internal* model of other agents (i.e., without needing visibility of other agents’ reward functions)
- Implications: is influence always essential to achieve learning?

## Discussion

- Why this paper?
	- Boundaries of what ML can do – beyond classification; can we model higher-level human functions?
	- Social influencing is crucial to humans today – cognitive development and society
	- Materialist – everything emerges from the structure of natural laws
- RL is exciting because it offers a framework for agents to act and interact with environments
	- RL explore/exploit state through actions, learn via rewards ([[Reinforcement learning]])
- Are conditions of the world and emergent complexity enough for human-like intelligence to develop?
	- Features of human intelligence: generalized executive ability, independent learning, output of art and music, intuition, emergent social complexity, morality, philosophy
- Game theory and multiple actors
	- Cooperation vs. non-cooperation
	- Partial information
