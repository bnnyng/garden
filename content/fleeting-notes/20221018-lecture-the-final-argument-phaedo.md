# Lecture: The final argument for the immortality of soul
---
## Cebes' weaver and cloak
- Cebes' objection grants the affinity argument, but targets Socrates' claim about the **immortality of soul.**
	- In Cebes' objection, the weaver is the *productive cause*.
	- Socrates responds with a *general theory of destruction*.
- The conversation shifts from *ethical dialogue* to the nature of objects themselves (i.e., ontology).
	- A similar pursuit is seen in Euthyphro for "piety" and Meno for "virtue."
	- The pursuit of a general theory still depends on the senses; objects relate to things in the *sensible world*.
- Main issue: How do explanations "figure" in a world in flux?

## Paradoxes of change

> Imagine not being able to distinguish the real cause from that without which the cause would not be able to act as a cause. (Phaedo, 99b)

- Explanations must distinguish between "the real cause" and "what needs to exist for the cuase to operate."
	-  **Explanatory regress** = as demonstrated by Anaxgoras, the cause is continuously credited to the thing that came before.
	- Example: Food is not the cause of nutrition.
	- Example: Arithmetic symbols in math are incidental, they don't explain *why* 8+2=10. In fact, symbols indicate an explanation is needed.

> That seemed to me much like saying that Socrates’ actions are all due to his mind, and then in trying to tell the causes of everything I do, to say that the reason that I am sitting here is because my body consists of bones and sinews, ... , and that is the cause of my sitting here with my limbs bent. (Phaedo, 98d)

- Socrates critiques Anaxagoras’ theory of mind as a moving principle, which allows different properties to come together and separate.
	- Socrates is initially optimistic about "Mind" as a first cause.
- Explanations must be *uniform* in all cuases of chnage.

## The new hypothetical method

> I would gladly become the disciple of any man who taught the workings of that kind of cause. However, since I was deprived and could neither discover it myself nor learn it from another, do you wish me to give you an explanation of how, as a **second best,** I busied myself with the search for the cause, Cebes? (Phaedo, 99c)

- Socrates has given up on a **top-down explanation**; instead, his **"second sailing"** settles into an *explanatory niche.*
- An explanation is considered **unsafe** when it can be used to explain the opposite change in another context (echoes criteria for a good account in the "Euthyphro").
- The **new hypothetical method** is different from the geometric hypothesis in the "Meno."
	- **Geometric hypothesis** = a *constructive* proof, deriving something more general (i.e., a mathematical [[Propositional logic|proposition]] or theorem) from specific successful examples.
	- The Greek **hypothesis** is a **stepping stone**, not a theory to be assumed or tested.
	- The geometric hypotheical method doesn't work for making a general account of change because the changes are too varied; inquiry is impossible to start.
	- The **new hypothetical method** is **logical.**

> A similar thought crossed my mind, and I feared that my soul would be altogether blinded if I looked at things with my eyes and tried to grasp them with each of my senses. So I thought I must take refuge in discussions and **investigate the truth of things by means of words**. (Phaedo, 99e)

##### Socrates' hypothesis
- What are the metaphysics of perfect accounts?
	- "Accounts of something explain change *with regards to* that thing."
	- Example: Beauty explains the beauty of some particular **instantiation** of beauty.

> All beautiful things are beautiful by the Beautiful. That, I think, is the **safest answer** I can give myself or anyone else. (Phaedo, 100e)

- **Explanation by Forms** = "particular fs have f-ness because of F itself."
	- A *local explanation* of beauty depends on the features (e.g., color, shape) of the instantiated element, but the *global explanation* is general.

## The final argument

#### Three-level ontology
- The final argument is important because it gives a general explanation for a world in *flux*.
	1. **Forms** = the ultimate causes/explanations. 
		- "The F itself never causes anything to be non-F in any respect."
	2. **Properties** = the qualities of something *instantiating* some **Form** that are **uniform**.
		- **Uniform** = never becoming its opposite.
		- Properties come to be and pass away along with the instantiated object.
	3. **Particular things** = bearers of properties, which are always changing.
- **Change** is the *displacement* of one **property** by another (i.e., one property "wins" over the other).

#### Higher hypothesis
- Some **particulars** bear **properties** necessarily and always by their *nature*. 
	- Examples: Fire is the **bearer** of hot, because fire makes things hot; likewise, three is the **bearer** of odd.
- Socrates argues that the soul is the **bearer** of life.

#### The immortality of soul
- The **final argument** presents soul and life similarly to the **affinity argument**.
	- When individuals **change** with regards to some **property**, the **opposite** property is displacing it; it either flees or is destroyed.
	- When the opposite approaches a **bearer**, the bearer must be destroyed.
	- When death approaches the soul, the soul cannot *admit* death.
- The soul is immortal because it is both *the cause of life* and *something that has life*. Socrates argues that "nothing like this can die."
