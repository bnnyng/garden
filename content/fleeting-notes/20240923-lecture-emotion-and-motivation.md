# Overview

- Social neuroscience investigation of emotion began with trying to identify one-to-one mappings of brain regions with the six basic emotions. 
- Today, people look at how multiple brain systems—a **domain-general** view—work together to drive emotional states. 
- The amygdala is particularly important for *learning* responses, particularly fear responses.

# Main concepts

- Basic definition of emotion:
	- Components of emotion
	- 6 basic emotions
	- Circumplex model, 3D version
	- Barrett’s conceptual act model
- Brain regions for emotion:
	- Amygdala and fear, a domain-general view?
	- Posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)
	- Fear conditioning results from mice studies
	- Insula and disgust
- Brain regions for motivation:
	- Dopamine reward system in striatum
	- Ventral striatum
	- Reward prediction error
	- Oribtofrontal cortex
- Social reward:

# Emotion

## The amygdala

- The “textbook example” of the amygdala’s purpose is a fear response/alarm bell.
- The amygdala is *flexible* enough to respond to information that is “important to us” in a given context, both positive and negative. This holds across verbal, visual, etc. stimuli.
- Physiological measures for fear/arousal include: skin conductance response, heart rate.

##### The amygdala is involved in learning evaluative associations about other people

**Paper: [Olsen et al. (2005). “The role of social groups in the persistence of learned fear.”](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16051800/)**

- Amygdala reacts most strongly to information that matches subjective evaluations!

##### The amygdala is not *just* an alarm bell; its response depends on context and goal

**Paper: [Cunningham, et al. (2008). “Affective Flexibility: Evaluative Processing Goals Shape Amygdala Activity.”**](https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1064&context=poliscifacpub)

- If the amygdala was only responsible for a fear response, we would see little response to the positive condition + positive stimulus pairing.

**Paper: [Freeman et al. (2014). “Amygdala responsivity to high-level social information from unseen faces.”**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25100591/)

##### The amygdala’s response to a visual stimulus depends on context

**Paper: [Kim et al. (2004). “Contextual modulation of amygdala responsivity to surprised faces.”**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15701225/)

- Note that verbal information (which creates the context) alone does not elicit as much response!

# Motivation

- Dopamine neurons exchange information in “loops” throughout the striatum.
- Like the amygdala, dopamine neurons are essential for *learning*. In particular, dopamine neurons respond to **reward prediction error**, the difference between predicted and actual reward.
