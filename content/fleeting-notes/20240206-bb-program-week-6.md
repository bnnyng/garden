# Review

> What were my biggest wins from last week?

- I reconnected with some friends for my birthday.
- I finished MCM. This isn’t a *win* exactly, more like an expectation, and I didn’t perform in the way I wanted to. Still, it was tough, and I got it done. A lot of urges came up, and even though the ones I didn’t engage in was out of *necessity*, it was still good practice I think.

> What were the 2-3 biggest challenges I experienced?

- I deliberately stopped thinking about recovery. I stopped being able to think of myself as being in the process of recovery. I relapsed wildly during MCM, and I regret it—I should have been working or resting.
- I have had a hard time eating enough and consistently. I am at the lowest weight of my adult life—92.7 pounds—and I feel very empty about it. I don’t want to gain or lose weight, but I’m struggling to feel any sort of way about my body’s current state. I think this is related to my feeling of wanting to disengage from everything.
- I feel like I wasted a lot of time on junk both mentally and physically, and I’m very guilty.

> What helped me? What worked to create those successes?

- Connecting with other people, even for one evening, kept me grounded and gave me some kind of hope in things other than myself.
- Having an external force to keep me accountable.
- Getting to listen to other people’s life patterns and thought processes, as in MCM.

> What am I going to *keep* doing?

- Waking up early
- Reading a lot and expanding my knowledge

> What am I going to *stop* doing?

- Purging, lol

> What am I going to *start* doing?

- Start making recovery a deliberate part of my life again
- Spend more time with other people, actually leaving my home and engaging with the world
- Checking in with my internal state when I feel discomfort with a situation
- Complete my recovery journal each day, and actually go through themed journal prompts

# Next week

> What are my top three goals for next week? How will I measure them?

- **Commit to abstinence from purging.** I need to remember that this doesn’t have to be forever. I keep relapsing because I am afraid of losing bulimia permanently, so I am putting off my recovery. In truth, I’m not anywhere near ready to let go of eating disordered behaviors. The easiest way to stick to this goal is to keep it temporary—I just want to see what will happen.
- **Reach out to someone each day, whether over text or in person.** The self-isolation keeps me stuck in my thoughts, which in turn keeps me stuck in my disorder. Being so separate from others makes me forget “how to be a real person.”
- **Check in with the recovery group each day.** Even if it’s just reading the texts. I want to remind myself that I am not alone with my struggles, and that others have been in my place and want to move on. This runs a bit against the weekly theme, but I’m still in a place where I need to take recovery seriously first.

# Themed journal questions

>Take an inventory of your life. List everything that takes up your time and mental space. Put rough time amounts you think you spend on each category.
- Look at the inventory list. What are the thoughts and feelings that come up?
- Where do you want your time to go? (if you don’t know, guess. Explore what you think you might enjoy or want.)
- What do you want to spend time thinking about? (it’s easier to let bulimia fade when you know what to focus on.)
- What ruminating thoughts do you want to be aware of and think less about intentionally?
