	- [ ] Read representative papers
	
	>- How do people teach and communicate?
	>- How do groups coordinate their thoughts, plans, and actions to achieve joint goals?
	>- How do people plan and learn in complex, uncertain environments?
	>- How do cognitive biases emerge from the avoidance of mental effort?
	>- How can we align interactive machine learning systems with human cognition and values?
