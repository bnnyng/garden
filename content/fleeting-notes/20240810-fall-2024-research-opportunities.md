	>1. I develop algorithms for probabilistic and causal reasoning. These algorithms are generic in the sense that they are able to compute answers to a wide variety of queries posed on a wide variety of models.
	>2. I formalise novel forms of reasoning, reducing the gap between what we can reason about as humans, and what is within the domain of automated reasoning.

	>- How do people teach and communicate?
	>- How do groups coordinate their thoughts, plans, and actions to achieve joint goals?
	>- How do people plan and learn in complex, uncertain environments?
	>- How do cognitive biases emerge from the avoidance of mental effort?
	>- How can we align interactive machine learning systems with human cognition and values?
