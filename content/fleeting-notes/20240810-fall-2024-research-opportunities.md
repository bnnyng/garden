## ✏ In progress

- [ ] ###### [Mark Ho (NYU) – Computation and Decision-Making Lab](https://codec-lab.github.io/)
	- [ ] Read representative papers
	
	>- How do people teach and communicate?
	>- How do groups coordinate their thoughts, plans, and actions to achieve joint goals?
	>- How do people plan and learn in complex, uncertain environments?
	>- How do cognitive biases emerge from the avoidance of mental effort?
	>- How can we align interactive machine learning systems with human cognition and values?
- [ ] 🔗 [Robb Rutledge](https://rutledgelab.org/)
	- [ ] Read 1-2 representative papers, take notes on most interesting research aspects
	- [ ] Email for NYC connections (thoughts on JK/SB tea time conversation?)
