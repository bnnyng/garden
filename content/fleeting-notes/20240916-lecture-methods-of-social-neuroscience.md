# Main concepts

- Neurons:
	- Action potential and spiking rate
	- Regional functional specialization
- Brain anatomy:
	- Gray vs. white matter
	- Corpus callosum
	- Brodmann’s areas (BA)
	- fMRI slice planes
	- Cortex
	- Subcortex: basal ganglia, limbic system, thalamus, hypothalamus
- Brain methods:
	- Computer mouse-tracking
	- Electromyography (EMG)
	- Event-related potentials (ERP)
	- Functional neuroimaging, fMRI
	- Hemodynamic response function
	- Voxels
	- Contrast experimental design (t-test)
	- Correcting for multiple statistical comparison (Bonferroni correction)
	- Spatial smoothing
	- Motion correction
	- Talairach and MNI atlases
	- Analysis of variance (ANOVA)
	- Multi-voxel pattern analysis, classification vs. similarity

# Functional neuroimaging

## Preprocessing

- **Blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) response** = the signal being measured in functional ma
- **Hemodynamic response function** = curve for change in BOLD signal over time.

## Data analysis

# Review

#### Functional neuroimaging

**Definitions**
- Blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response
- Hemodynamic response function 

**Preprocessing**

- What is **jittering** and why is it useful?
- What is the **subtraction procedure** described in [[@2003cacioppo]]?
- Why use a **contrast** experimental design (e.g., using face vs. non-faces stimuli as opposed to using faces vs. a blank screen “control”/design)? How is it related to the subtraction procedure?
- What is **spatial smoothing** and what is its purpose in fMRI imaging?

**Data analysis**
- What is the main goal of **multi-voxel pattern analysis**? What are the two types of analysis used in MVPA “decoding” (i.e., identifying what condition led to neural response)?
