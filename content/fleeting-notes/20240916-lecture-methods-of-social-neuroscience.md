## Preprocessing

- **Blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) response** = the signal being measured in functional ma
- **Hemodynamic response function** = curve for change in BOLD signal over time.

# Review

#### Functional neuroimaging

**Definitions**
- Blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response
- Hemodynamic response function 

**Preprocessing**

- What is **jittering** and why is it useful?
- What is the **subtraction procedure** described in [[@2003cacioppo]]?
- Why use a **contrast** experimental design (e.g., using face vs. non-faces stimuli as opposed to using faces vs. a blank screen “control”/design)? How is it related to the subtraction procedure?
- What is **spatial smoothing** and what is its purpose in fMRI imaging?

**Data analysis**
- What is the main goal of **multi-voxel pattern analysis**? What are the two types of analysis used in MVPA “decoding” (i.e., identifying what condition led to neural response)?
