# Class note: Memory
---
## Overview

There are three stages of memory: **sensory memory**, short-term or **working memory**, and **long-term memory**. **Sensory memory** enters **working memory** through attention, while working memory can be transferred to and retrieved from long-term storage. 

Squire's taxonomy of **long-term memory** distinguishes between **declarative memory**, which concerns facts and events, and **non-declarative memory**, which includes procedural memory, priming and perceptual learning, classical condition, and non-associative learning.

The four major memory computations involve defining **data**, **storage**, **retrieval**, and **transmission** or **use**. **Memory consolidation** is the process of reducing the total data extracted from what is perceived. Memory data can also be **accurate** or **inaccurate**. **Memory retrieval** can be **random access** or **content-addressable**, also known as **associative**.

## Key terms

- **Declarative memory** = also called **explicit memory**; facts and events that can be *consciously* retrieved and reported.
	- **Event declarative memory** is also called episodic memory.
- **Non-declarative memory** = also called **implicit memory**; facts and associations which cannot be consciously remembered and reported, but is retrieved through *performance*.
	- **Procedural memory** = performance of skills and behaviors.
		- **Skills** = behaviors that are improved through repetition.
		- **Habits** = behaviors that are automatically activated by context.
	- **Priming** = when a behavior or mental act is enhanced by *prior exposure*.
	- **Perceptual learning** = using perceptual cues to learn regularities in the environment.
	- **Conditioning** = the learned association between a behavior and an unrelated stimulus.
		- **Classical conditioning** = association is formed between an involuntary behavior and a stimulus.
		- **Operant conditioning** = association is formed between a voluntary behavior and a specific consequence; the voluntary behavior is increased through reward and decreased through punishment. 
	- **Non-associative learning** = the altering of behavior in response to a single event or stimulus, rather than pairing behavior with stimuli.
		- **Habituation** = decrease in response after repeated exposure.
		- **Sensitization** = increase in response after repeated exposure.
- **Memory consolidation** = the process of reducing the amount of **data** from perception to long-term memory; distinct from memory **deletion**, or forgetting.
	- **Thresholding** = also known as **digitizing**; reducing memory data to a binary "yes" or "no" question.
	- **Compression** = when a set of specific memory data is reduced to its **average** or the **proportion/frequency** of each type of data.
	- **Temporal discount** = produces a **weighted average** by prioritizing recent data over more temporally distant data.
- **Generalization** = the ability to use past experiences to determine behavior in similar but *novel* situations.
- **Random access memory** = items in memory are stored *systematically* as entries with searchable addresses.
- **Content addressable memory** = also known as **associative memory**; takes incorrect or incomplete inputs and outputs the address of a *closest match*. 
	- **State-dependent retrieval** = a phenomenon where people **retrieve** memories more effectively when their entire experience has been constructed.
	- **Hopfield network** = a **recurrent neural network** that shows a **state** of activity corresponding with a memory being retrieved.

## Computation taxonomy of memory

#### Data
- Data **consolidation** comes in degrees: forgetting; **digitizing**, or reducing inputs to **binary storage**; tracking **frequencies**; and taking an average with a **temporal discount**.
- People with **hyperthymesia**, or near-perfect episodic memories, perform *no consolidation* of memory data. This means that their memory is identical to their *original perception*.
- Data **consolidation** has several potential advantages:
	- Data uses less of limited storage;
	- Easier detection of abstract patterns and trends in the environment;
	- Easier searching, since behaviorally irrelevant data is reduced;
	- Helps with recognition;
	- Helps with **generalization**.
- Data **inaccuracy** has several potential advantages:
	- Uses less time and resources;
	- Fewer distractions from important averages and trends;
	- Biases towards the average, instead of using locally inaccurate perceptions, leads to more accuracy on the *whole*;
	- Accurate memories can interfere with our ability to remember *differences*.

#### Storage
- The **format** of memory can be pictures or sentences.
	- See also: The debate over mental imagery in cognitive science.
- Memory is **retrieved** using either a **random access memory** or **content addressable memory** model.

#### Subtracting
- Subtracting and forgetting can be accomplished by further **memory consolidation**.
- Subtracting for **RAM** can occur by deleting or reusing a **memory slot**, or losing or reusing a **memory address**.
- Subtracting for **CAM** can occur when there are too many memories in general, too many *similar* memories, too much *randomness* in network **weights**, and when **stimuli** becomes too *dissimilar* from memories.
