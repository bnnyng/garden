- Arc prize winners open source (85 percent human performance)
- “Efficiency is the hallmark of intelligence”
- O1 (OpenAI)
	- Not a paradigm shift in the approach to deep learning via scale
	- Somewhat of a shift?
- Hypothesis: LLM performance on a task is purely a function of task familiarity (not task complexity) → LLMs can solve any problem as long as it memorizes solution
	- Database of skill programs (related: [[Large language models store the dynamics of human language]], but also human formal systems)
	- *Solution: make a perfect formalism for human reasoning?*
- Concepts of intelligence (not memorization, similar to [[The Turing test]] argument)
	- Static skills vs. fluid intelligence (novel synthesis of programs)
	- Low abstraction vs. high abstraction, stronger generalization
	- Data-hungry vs. information-efficient program acquisition
- Intelligence is different from skill – both behaviorally defined?
	- Intelligence is the process (computation) and skill is output
- Two types of abstraction – removing things that don’t matter and leave reusable building blocks
	- **Value-centric** = a *continuous* domain, set of prototypes and distance function
	- **Program-centric** = discrete, program-like, graphs of operations; looking for *graph isomorphisms*
		- THIS is human reasoning (computationalism basically)
		- Renormalization = knowing what information to throw away about the world in order to preserve an informative, but causally closed explanation (related: [[Coarse-graining]], [[Renormalization]])
- Solution: program synthesis from input/output pairs
	- Program synthesis = combinatorial search?
	- Do you need to guess? Or is there an intuitive way to coarse-grain? e.g., biological pattern matching
- Application
	- Deep learning manifold = program space

# ARC prize

- What counts as a conceptual paper – what are the requirements for materials?
- Data for human performance is available for public set – but will be published for the V2 dataset

# Questions

- Resource rationality is why humans can’t achieve perfection – even with unfathomable amounts of compute/scale, techniques are not meeting this. Thoughts on human-like reasoning?
- Potential relevance of computational cognitive science/human intelligence
	- Obviously comparisons between artificial and human intelligence are tenuous…
