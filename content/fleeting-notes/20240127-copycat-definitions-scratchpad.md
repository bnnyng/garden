- **Concept mapping** = a “slippage” between two concepts
	- **Distinguishing** = when an object’s descriptors uniquely identify its objects
- **Rule** = a description of the change from initial to modified string

## Slipnet
- **Slip node** = a representation of a single “Platonic” concept
	- **Descriptor** = includes **description types** of numbers, letters, string positions, alphabetic positions, directions, bond types, group types, and other relations


## Workspace

- **Workspace object** = a letter or group
	- **Description** = a class for the description of a single letter or group
	- **Raw importance value** = sum of all relevant description activations
	- **Intra-string happiness** = a value to represent how well the object is fitting into a structuring of a string; a function of the strength of bonds or a group involving the object
	- **Inter-string happiness** = a value to represent how well the object is fitting in a mapping from initial string to the target string
	- **Intra-string salience** = how much attention the object needs from structure-building codelets (i.e., for bonds and groups) inside a single string.
- **Bond** = a relation between letters and/or groups in the same string
- **Workspace** = where the Copycat instance builds perceptual structures
