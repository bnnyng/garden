# Meeting notes

- Independent study
	- Find BC/CU professor? – send email to John Morrison, Prof. Fleig-Goldstein, and cogsci at Barnard explaining independent project, ask for faculty recommendations; “I just spoke with Prof. Senghas, who can I be my local faculty advisor?”
	- Proposal is a preliminary plan, but can be changed at professor’s discretion
- Potential product ideas – “you will generate the amount of work you would generate in a three-credit class”
	- Methods section of a conference poster
	- Figures

# Preparatory notes

Preparatory notes for meeting on 2024-09-05 with Ann Senghas.

#### General education requirements
- Would Intro Psych suffice for the psychology requirement? I know it’s not ideal and I could technically squeeze it in, but…

#### Cognitive science specialization
- Typical timeline for choosing? How long until most students are certain?
- How obviously related should courses be? Maybe additional justification (e.g., the Neural Code models different neural systems, can be considered related to “Diverse and Augmented Intelligences”)?
- Relation between specialization and final project, esp. if final project is built off ongoing research?
- Idea: “Diverse and augmented intelligences”

#### Independent study

**Explanation of independent study process from Prof. Senghas:**
```
Yes, you can do an independent study outside the department, and it can count toward your specialization (if it fits topically, of course). You could register for an independent study in Cognitive Science (COGS UN3900), or you could do an independent study in one of our connected departments like Neuroscience, Psychology, Linguistics, etc., since courses in those departments can count towards a Cognitive Science major. If the professor is from a school outside Barnard College or Columbia, you would register for COGS UN3900 with me.

To do an independent study, you need to make a proposal together with the professor who will mentor you. You fill out the Independent Study form that includes a description of the project as well as readings, meeting times, etc.  When it is approved, a section will be created for you to register for. You can access the form on Slate or from the Cognitive Science program website (look under the FORMS AND LINKS tab). I just checked the page myself and it says the form is “closed for the summer” so you may have to wait another week before it opens.

**Explanation of [[ucr-final-abstract]] research:**
```
Thank you for the thorough explanation. My research project is broadly in the field of computational social science/natural language processing. I am trying to characterize the collective problem solving strategies of mathematicians working online by measuring their exploration/exploitation of topics. I began this project over the summer, and I've attached an abstract for the project I wrote at the end of that program. I am being mentored by Simon DeDeo (Carnegie Mellon) and Marina Dubova (Santa Fe Institute, previously Indiana University).

My time on this project is mostly spent working with the actual data and reading papers that have relevant theory/methods. The reading schedule is not set ahead of time. How do you suggest we structure the independent study?
