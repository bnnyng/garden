# Review

> What were my biggest wins from last week?

- I got through two evenings without relapsing, which showed me that I *can* do it. The next step is to do it more regularly!
- I rediscovered a few hobbies – reading more, painting, working on a new coding project, learning about tea. Although some of these feel more like I’m going through the motions than genuinely passionate, I know that passion is not a requirement to do anything, and I am learning to enjoy tasks for their own sake.

> What were the 2-3 biggest challenges I experienced?

- I’ve started to have a lot of anxiety around eating. This means that I’m not eating enough throughout the day, which adds to my urges to binge in the evening.
- I relapsed every evening that I went to work, and I still haven’t been able to break that habit loop.
- On evenings I don’t work and don’t have anything scheduled to keep me active, I get tired very early on, and then I feel the urge to fill that time by binging because I’m too “lazy” to do anything else.

> What helped me? What worked to create those successes?

- It helped me to have tasks other than recovery to keep me engaged, mostly projects during the day and book reading at night.
- I let myself be tired at the end of the day. I do not try to deny that I’m tired, but I also find that I can push myself a little until the time I actually need to go to bed.
- I paused a lot more during my regular day! Making tea helped with this. I got into a habit of reflecting on my own mental state and naming my emotion I was feeling frustrated, distracted, or overstimulated – all times where I am most likely to binge.

> What am I going to *keep* doing?

- Eating my safe meals
- Staying active throughout the day
- Pause when I transition between tasks, particularly when I have tunnel vision from working on one thing for a long time

> What am I going to *stop* doing?

- Leaving my job with the anticipation that I *might* binge. There should be no ambiguity about the fact that I’m headed straight home
- Seeing being home alone as an *opportunity* to get away with relapse – I am hurting only myself

> What am I going to *start* doing?

- Pushing myself to keep busy in the evening, ride that first wave of tiredness
- Wake up and go to bed at the same time each day, instead of leaving it as an open question
- Journal a LOT more about my feelings and thoughts about recovery, instead of trying to leave them in the past out of embarrassment. I need to take advantage of every event as a learning moment
- Be in more contact with my friends, make my life more well-rounded

# Next week

> What are my top three goals for next week? How will I measure them?

1. Commit to *abstinence* from purging.
2. Practice self-care by performing my full night routine each evening: have dinner and take an easy walk for digestion, brush teeth, take off any make-up, shower, and wind down for bed by doing any other self-maintenance tasks and curling up with a good book.
3. Check in with friends via messages or in person each day.

> What are important tasks and events I need to stay aware of?

- CUMMW feedback meeting on Tuesday
- Mathematical modeling contest begins on Thursday; logistics/information meeting on Wednesday
- Break Through Tech AI application due the following Monday; have first drafts completed by the time MCM begins

# Themed journal questions

- Think of your body or look at your body. What are all the unfiltered thoughts and feelings that come up?
- How do those thoughts and feelings influence your actions throughout the day?
- What do you want to think and feel towards your body & why?
- If you unconditionally love your body, how would you think and act towards it and its perceived flaws?
- How can you treat your body with love and respect on purpose regardless of its state?
