Tolman’s “field map” theory of animal learning claims that the brain processes stimuli into a cognitive map of the environment. Further, these maps are distinguished between “narrow, strip-like” maps, which are useful in specific set-ups, and “broad, comprehensive” maps, which can be used in different contexts—in Tolman’s experiments, set-ups and contexts are mazes that rats are required to navigate.

The functional outcome of these two types of maps reminds me of a popular topic in the theory of intelligence: generalization. The an agent’s ability to *generalize* past experience to novel contexts is taken to be a sign of intelligence, and the idea of artificial *general* intelligence is highly controversial (among people who care about this sort of thing) precisely because of its potential to reach human-like generalization abilities. Tolman’s field maps seem to be a spatial example of mental representations in general (I am unsure why he stuck to the spatial metaphor in his speculating about human psychological abnormalities/biases when he could have appealed to general mental representations, but perhaps he wanted to draw a direct link between rat and human cognition). I disagree with Tolman in that general and specific field maps should not be considered oppositions, but complementary. I think one uses a coarser representation (e.g., of the problem space) to select between different narrow, fine-grained representations to solve a given problem. If we take generalization to be some marker of intelligence, then intelligence would depend on the ability to select between finer maps using coarser ones.
