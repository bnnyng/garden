# Lecture: The structure of facts
---
## Context: Plato's metaphysical muddle
- Why was Aristotle motivated to write this text?
	- Background: Aristotle studied with Plato, did some things related to biology, then returned to Athens; Categories comes early in his career.
	- Socrates' second sailing is limited; the hypothesis about the "logic" of change is never fully explained (see [[20221018-lecture-the-final-argument-phaedo]]).
- **Category** = (mode of) predication; how one term can be applied to another.
	- The theoretical vocabulary of **categories** is Aristotle's invention.
	- Different modes are needed since not every predication takes the form of "particular $f$ participating in $F$."
	- Aristotle uses **linguistic structuring,** or investigation by words, to explain how change is possible.
- Plato and Aristotle agree that change is caused by an **asymmetry** "something applied" and "something *being*," but have opposite ways of locating the explanation (i.e., *what* is being predicated).
	- Contrast with Anaxagoras who denied the difference between subject and predicate, and "Parmenidean uniformity," where everything is "what is."
	- Plato says: $F$ is the explanatory *bedrock*, while $f$ is the **subject** of predication.

## Aristotle's fundamental principle

- **Aristotle's fundamental (ontological) principle** = "The basic explanatory entities (i.e., explanatory *bedrock*) are the **fundamental subjects of predication**."
	- The thing *being predicated* is lower than the thing *predicated of*.
	- Plato's "features" are also "things."
	- **Subject of predication** = the thing at the bottom that canot be predicated further.
- **Categories** = names that give the structure of facts.

## (Cat. 1) Names and facts

- There are three types of **relations** when we apply *words* to *things*.
	- **Hononomy** = The term only *properly* belongs to a thing in virtue of being an account.
	- **Synonymy** = The same term is used in virtue of an account for two things in a non-trivial case.
	- **Paronymy** = The terms that properly apply to different things are different.
- A theory for the **structure of facts** is needed to make sense of Aristotle's **fundamental principle.**

#### Hononomy
> If things have only a name in common, and the account of the essense corresponding to the name is different for each, they are called **homonymous.** ... For if what one says what being an animal is for each of \[a man] and \[a painted animal], one will give a different **account** in each case. (Categories, 1a1)

- Example: A statue of a horse is called a horse *in virtue of* looking like a living horse.

#### Paronymy
> If things are called what they are by having a name that is derived from something else, but with a different **inflection**, they are called **paronymous.** (Categories, 1a12)

- Canonical example: A brave person *has* bravery.
	- Saying a "person is bravery" is nonsensical.
	- The "-y" version of the term indicates the *dependence* of one thing on another; dependence is captured by *linguistic inflection*.
- **Paronymy** is implicit in the final argument in the [[plato-phaedo|Phaedo]].
	- In Aristotle's theory: "Things are beautiful *in terms of* Beauty, and beauty also comes from further facts."

## (Cat. 2-4) Types of predication

> Among being some **are said of** a subject but **are not in** any subject. ... Some **are in** a subject but **are not said of** any subject. (By "in a subject" I mean what **belongs in** something, not as a part, and **cannot exist separately of from what it is in**.) (Categories 1a20)

- Beings are devided according to their relation to a subject.
	- Aristotle distinguishes between a thing **characterizing** a subject ("is said of") and **being a feature of** ("is in") a subject.
	- There also exist things that can be *both* characteristics and features, and things that are *neither* characteristic nor feature.
	- Thus, there are four total ways of *being* "embroiled in predication."
- Predication is **transitive.**
	- Example: *Animal* is **predicated of** *man* is **predicated of** an individual man; thus, *animal* is also **predicated** of an individual man.
- Types of predication are **hierarchical**; the **categories** are the **highest types of predication**.


#### Two types of belonging to a subject
1. **$A$ characterizes $B$** = $A$ is what it means for some $B$ to be itself.

> If something **is said of** a subject, then both its name and its account must be **predicated of** the subject. (Categories, 2a20)

2. **$A$ is a feature of $B$** = the **existence** of $A$ depends on $B$.
	- There is an **asymmetry** in $A$ between different $B$s.
	- *Dependency* is that, in a sense, $B$ explains (i.e., gives an account of) what it means for $A$ to "be in."
	- Example: Individual **instance of** grammatical knowledge in a soul, individual **instance of** white on the wall.

> If something **is in** a subject, in most cases neither its name nor its account is **predicated of** the subject. In some cases the name may well be predicated of the subject, but the account still cannot be predicated. (Categories, 2a28)

#### The four ways of being
$$ \begin{array} {| c | c | c |} 
\hline
\text{ } & \text{can be in a subject} & \text{cannot be in a subject} \\
\text{ } & \text{(features)} & \text{(that to which features belong)} \\
\hline
\text{can be said of a subject} & \text{< properties >} & \text{< types >} \\
\text{(universals)} & \text{(e.g., knowledge, color)} & \text{(e.g., human, horse)} \\
\hline
\text{cannot be said of a subject} & \text{< tropes >} & \text{< subjects >} \\
\text{(particulars)} & \text{(e.g., instance of color)} & \text{(e.g., you, me, Secretariat)} \\
\hline
\end{array} $$
- Aristotle's **categories** are the ten **types of being**: substance, quantity, quality, relative, where, when, being in a position, having, acting on, being affected.

> None of these things ... is said all *by itself* in any **affirmation**; an **affirmation** results from the *combination* of these things with one another. For every affirmation seems to be either true or false, whereas nothing said without combination ... is either true or false. (Categories 2a5)

- Statements that have a **truth value** must combine "predicate" and a "thing that is being predicated of."
	- Some **predications** are "in the mode of" **substance**.
	- Certain **substances** are closer to **subjecthood** than others.
	- The **subject** in Aristotle's **fundamental principle** are at the bottom of a "chain" of predicaitons.

## (Cat. 5) Aristotle's qualified Platonism

- Platonic insight: Calling something by a **secondary substance** is to say something about the "substantiality" of a **primary substance**.

> In the case of **primary substances**, it is indisputably true that each of them signifies a **this**. ... In the case of **secondary substances,** ... each signifies a sort of thing, for the subject is not one ... but \[said of] many things. (Categories 3a10)

 - **Primary substances** are **fundamental**, while **secondary substances** are **repeatable**.
	 - Primary substances don't have **contraries** and don't come in **degrees**.
- Plato thinks the **particular** (i.e., individual) things are what admit **change**, while Aristotle thinks they admit **stability** (i.e., the bottom that cannot be "said of" something else).

#### Two types of substances
1. **Primary substances** = the subjects for all other things are predicated of (i.e., primary substances are what all other things are "said of" or "in"). 

> For all the other things are either said of these as subjects or are in these as subjects, so that **if the primary substances did not exist, neither could any of the other things exist**. (Categories, 2b6)

2. **Secondary substances** = the subjects for (i.e., which are predicated of) some things, but predicate the more primary substances.

> But as the primary substances are related to other things, so also is the species related related to the genus; for the species is a **subject** for the genus, since the genera are **predicated of** the species, whereas the species are not *reciprocally* predicated of the genera. (Categories, 2a18)

#### Aristotle's response to Plato
- Aristotle uses the **structure of language** to uncover something about the **structure of reality**.
- Is the application of language to reality unjustified?
	- If the **universals** were instead **primary**, would Socrates in the Phaedo agree?
