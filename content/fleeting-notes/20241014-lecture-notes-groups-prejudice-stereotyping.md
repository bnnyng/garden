- rTPJ lesions lead to less “coherent” sense of self
- Ongoing self
	- Skews past memories of beliefs
	- Ongoing positive regard
- Cultural self = study of groups
- Domain
- Lieberman et al. (2005) – *could* be that AA participants have activated amygdala because they internalize the same biases prevalent in culture
	- Prejudice vs. negative stereotypes – teasing apart is difficult (cognitive vs….)
	- Alternative explanations: UCLA students = minority on campus = other Black faces are more *motivationally relevant*, likely to interact, want to better understand
	- Upshot: can’t figure out what’s going 
- Minimal group paradigm = meaningless, arbitrary groups; us-vs-them mentality emerges
	- In-group favoritism and out-group prejudice
- Van Bavel et al. (2008)
	- Novel/minimal outgroup members
	- In-group effect
- 45 - Broader goal of amygdala research is to get a mechanistic understanding that allows us to make interventions (in the here and now, vs. changing society)
- IAT performance reflects **currently accessible representations**
	- Current approaches to changing implicit bias: no longer focused on IAT scores, but treating implicit biases like a habit

# Review

- Examples of why “amygdala” as alarm bell is inadequate for prejudice
	- Connections back to [[20240923-lecture-emotion-and-motivation|Lecture: Emotion and Motivation]]?
- What is the theory of bias as reduced mentalizing? Define dehumanization?
	- How is dehumanization operationalized in Harris & Fiske?
- What is the DLPFC doing?
