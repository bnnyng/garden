# Overview

# Preparation

During the month of January, my university hosts a “modeling workshop” to organize teams and prepare students for the February competition (notably, the workshop begins during winter break and therefore selects for the most…technically minded undergraduates). The workshop was a valuable opportunity to not only run a dress rehearsal for the actual competition, but get to know my teammates, who were strangers I’d cold-emailed.

The three contest problems are neatly divided into three types: continuous, discrete, and data-driven. Given our strengths (really, truly rudimentary statistics; applying machine learning libraries) and weaknesses (general lack of mathematical maturity), the data problem seemed the most accessible for our team. Evidently, most other competitors feel the same: the data problem received over 20,000 solutions and had 12 winners in 2023, compared to 4,000-5,000 solutions and four winners for the other two problem types. 

#### The problem

The 2023 data problem was about [[Pragmatic statistics|predicting]] future results for viral puzzle game [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html). Specifically, teams were challenged to model the following:

- Given a future date, predict the total number of reported Wordle results
- Identify any word attributes that contribute to the number of players in hard mode
- Given a hypothetical word on a future date, predict the distribution of guesses; that is, how many players report solving the puzzle with one guess, two guesses, and so on

The second point was a bit perplexing, since players do not know the answer word before choosing hard mode, so any relationship between attributes and hardmoders should only be coincidental. Thankfully, we had 12 previous winners to guide our interpretation.
#### Stage 1: Replicating a winning model

*Time: 17.5 hours*



#### Stage 2: Developing an alternative model

#### Stage 3: Crafting an MCM-level report
