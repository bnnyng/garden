# Lecture: The cognitive approach

## Perception
#### "Views" of perception
- The **mirroring view** of perception states that copies of the world "naturally" come into the brain through the senses. Perception is passively received.
- The **(re)constructive view** states that little information is actually received by the senses, and the brain must compensate by making **assumptions**. Perception involves an active filtering of information.
-  Cognitive science aims to make computational explanations for perceptual outcomes.

#### Canonical examples 
- Dalmation
	- Though initially hard to see, once the "assumption" of the dog is made it is easily seen again. Once we know what to *expect*, information about the dog is stored and reconstruction is easy.
	- Perception actively searches through varying levels of abstraction.
- Concave and convex dots
	- When faced with ambiguous stimuli, the perceptual system "guesses" based on which one seems more likely. *Disambiguation* happens through assumption.
	- Cognitive science explanation: Identify which illuminations and geometries are consistent; decide which interpretation is more probable; percieve that illumination and geometry
- Ames room
	- Cognitive science explanation: Assume geometries based on information sensed; decide on most probable geometries (wall is straight, floor is level); perceive that geometry
- Time dialation
	- Cognitive science explanation: Time is a result of inner rhythmic processes, where internal "clicks" are counted to estimate time; when the clicks speed up, cognition "speeds up" to make the world seem "slower"
		- Result: No difference in time perception between people in high stress and people in low stress

## Navigation
- Tollman's maze
	- Cognitive science explanation: Rats have an internal map which can be used to reach a desried location
	- Imaging studies show hippocampal activity associated with location. The map may be physically represented with "place cells."

## Consciousness
- Inattentional blindness
	- Cognitive science explanation: Lots of perceptual information comes through the senses to a "global workspace"; signals are then selectively broadcasted to other parts of the brain

## Trauma
- Trauma is experienced as depersonalization, panicked states, and intrusive thoughts. Trauma is perceptual, since even talking about a traumatic memory can trigger an experience of "reliving" and become *retraumatizing*.
- Cognitive science explanation: Information is too "hot" and cannot be stored as a typical memory; when the memory is activated, traumatized people respond as if it is actualy happening
- One successful treatment involves talking about the trauma while also performing a spatially demanding activity, such as Tetris or EMDR therapy. These therapies focus attention elsewhere so that "reliving" occurs at a "subthreshold level."
