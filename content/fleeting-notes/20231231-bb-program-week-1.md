# Review

> What were my biggest wins from last week?

- I hit my goal of going two days in a row purge-free! This is huge for me, because the most I’ve been able to do is a single day for months now.
- Overall, I spent at least 30 hours doing “work” of some kind, and it was generally things I found interesting!
- I became passionate about something again—doing research. I feel like I have more hope for the future, now that I have an idea about a path that will satisfy me.
- I read and learned quite a lot!
- I ate out for dinner and did not relapse once I went home! This is a big win because I often use any disruption to my routine as an excuse to binge (although at this point, binging *is* in my routine; maybe the win is therefore being able to break that cycle for a night!).
- I showed myself that I was capable of falling asleep without bulimia.

> What were the 2-3 biggest challenges I experienced?

- I found it difficult to break out of my routine and be accountable to anyone other than myself. I lied about being sick in order to get out of two days of work.
- My life was not balanced. I did not make plans to see any friends (no “causal hangouts” blocked on my calendar, because apparently I can’t remember this for myself). In terms of physical activity, I did try to get my steps in and walk outside, but on some days I did not. I only had enough willpower to complete 15 minutes of a 30-minute Pilates video. 
- Being patient about sleep is still difficult for me. My sleep was definitely a lot more spotty on the two nights I did not relapse, and I think I spent a lot of time in a half-conscious state. The first night, I was able to reframe this into a positive thing, because I got the chance to read!

> What helped me? What worked to create those successes?

- Not having triggering foods around and eating safe foods for my first meal, which gave me a sense of stability at the start of the day.
- Interestingly, having a sense of control over my “normal” meal at the end of the day also led me to be more accepting of the urges to binge. As opposed to my parents cooking me food and me just eating it because it was there. I think that putting together my own food deliberately at a planned time allowed me to anticipate the urge that would come after, as if the “pause” was happening before I even took a bite.
- Waking up at 8:00 AM so I was tired in the evenings, instead of depending on binging and purging to tire me out.

> What am I going to *keep* doing?

- Waking up at 8:00 AM and going to bed before midnight, taking supplements to calm down and support my sleep.
- Walking outside during the day.

> What am I going to *stop* doing?

- Eating food I did not plan for and did not assemble myself.
- Making excuses for not eating deliberately, which always disguise a binge.
- Trying to suppress binge urges by distracting myself. This, counterproductively, leads to overstimulation and less mental energy to confront the urges.
- Pushing myself to the point of burnout and frustration with daily work.
- Starting a task that has a distinct beginning and end when it is late in the night (e.g., filing my nails/cuticles). Once I become tired of the task but yet feel pressured to finish, I will want to relapse.

> What am I going to *start* doing?

- Take breaks, especially physically, more frequently while I am working at my desk.
- Supplement with fish oil and Omega-3s for better brain health.
- Fill out my daily journal as soon as I wake up.

# Next week

> What are my top three goals for next week? How will I measure them?

- Be relapse-free for the majority of the days in the week. This will be measured by having 4/7 days relapse-free.
- Wake up at or before 9:00 AM each day, again.
- Draft all my essay responses for [[20231221-application-santa-fe-institute-undergraduate-research]]. I have two questions left, and I think the research proposal will be most difficult for me to write.

> What are important tasks and events I need to stay aware of?

- Starting class at 12:30 PM on Thursday; will need to plan my departure and schedule ahead of time.
- First recovery group call at 3 PM on Tuesday; second at 9 AM on Friday.
- Working Wednesday through Saturday; won’t be as much time to write my application.

# Themed journal questions

- What urge protocol am I choosing to implement this week?
- What basic eating plan will I follow this week?
- What about my environment encourages behaviors or makes it more difficult to not engage in behaviors?
- How can I make recovery as easy as possible for myself?
- How can I increase friction between me and my behaviors?
