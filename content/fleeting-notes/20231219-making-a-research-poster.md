## ([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYk29tnxASs)) How to create a better research poster in less time

### User experience design
- Design poster to reduce *cognitive load*
	- Simplest method: reduce details on the poster
- People seek smaller chunks of information to process quickly
- Two golden rules
	- Don’t put things on your poster that people will ignore
	- People will ignore most things!

### Information scent
- For typical posters, the title is the main source of information scent; typically, not particularly engaging
- **Interaction cost** = the difficulty of having to engage with the poster
	- Paying high amounts of interaction cost leads to information fatigue
- Upshot: want to create posters low interaction cost, low cognitive load, and strong information scent

### Poster design improvements
- Easy
	- Replace title with a statement that gets directly to the point (i.e., a full sentence; take it from the conclusion!)
- Challenge
	- Translate information to casual language
	- Use an easily interpretable image
		- Most ideally, use image from actual study, but often is hard to interpret
		- “Notional” graphics also work
		- Effect is to teach same fact in both text and image form
	- Trigger emotion
		- “Any science can be made emotional”
		- Design and colors!
	- Surprise and delight; do something delightful, make yourself giggle!
		- Additional design details
		- Puns and jokes
	- Look at “betterposter” templates that assist the observer while author is presenting

## ([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwiTqrVfDFU)) What makes a good research poster?

### Good poster principles
- Have good flow between sections
- Cut down on words
- Emphasize title and conclusion
	- Trick: use speech-to-text to see if the title is interpretable!
- Limit colors
- Try to avoid using university-provided posters

### Example
- Do a basic Google search to see which posters stand out
