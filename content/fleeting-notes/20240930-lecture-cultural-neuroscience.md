# Notes

## Introduction

#### What makes humans different?

- Unlikely to have evolved from natural selection pressures
- **Social brain hypothesis** = primate brain evolution was driven by *social* problem-solving, rather than domain-general problem solving
	- The main evolutionary pressure for humans was to be *socially* smarter

#### Brain size and social intelligence

- Brain size (**neocortex**) is correlated with size of social group, observations of tactical deception, social and non-social intelligence, length of immaturity

## Culture-gene co-evolutionary theory

#### Cultural differences in the self

- Independent vs. interdependent self-construal (self-concept) in Western vs. East Asian (or other collectivistic) cultures

#### 5-HTT
- Serotonergic uptake transporter gene 5-HTTLPR (serotonin-transporter-linked polymorphic region)
	- More intense action of the transporter
- Two allele variants
	- Long = more serotonin uptake (i.e., less available for post-synaptic binding)
	- Short = less serotonin uptake
	- Short is more susceptible to anxiety and mood disorders
- Upshot: Your entire brain is

# Review

- What are the key differences between an independent and interdependent self-construal?
	- What is different about the *role of others*?
- What are the diffe
