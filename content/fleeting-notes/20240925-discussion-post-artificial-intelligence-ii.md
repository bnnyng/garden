*Response to [[@1976newell]].*

I disagree Simon and Newell’s argument that intelligence is only possible within “symbolic systems,” but I agree with the general principles of their approach: qualities like intelligence, consciousness, and even life should be defined in terms of empirically observable attributes, and these qualities manifest on a continuum for different systems. In order to study intelligence in an empirical manner, we must absolve the term of the Platonic/rationalist anthropocentrism that it conveys now (e.g., “artificial intelligence” only considered intelligent enough to be threatening when it mimics complex human behaviors). I also agree that intelligence, whatever bundle of qualities we decide it to be, should have a teleological description: a system’s intelligence should have something to do with its ability to achieve goals and solve problems. I think that often, behavior we attribute to intelligence is more specifically behavior with *rationale*; that is, behavior that benefits from a rational system (one example for human social behavior is Grice’s axioms of conversation). Intelligent systems should be able to represent this rational system to some degree, whether they are able to reflect that they are doing so or not (most people do not have to know or care about Grice’s axioms). This aligns with Simon and Newell’s notion of a physical system; I’m just not convinced it has to be symbolic. Finally, I think the most complex of intelligent systems should have some self-referential capacity, the ability to affect both internal and external states.

With this view, Simon and Newell’s examples of computers and today’s neural networks certainly have intelligence; they prove the existence of non-biological intelligence (I was tempted to use the word “inorganic” but S&N literally begin by referring to computers as “organisms”…why?).

- I barely remember anything on my own; my “intelligence” lies in recognizing patterns and recording them ([[Humans as Turing machines]])
