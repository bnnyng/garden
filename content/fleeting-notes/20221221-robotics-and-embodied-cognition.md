# Class note: Robotics and embodied cognition
---
## Key terms
- **Moravec's paradox** = sensorimotor and perception skills require more *computational resources* than abstract reasoning.
- **Embodied cognition** = approaching the mind and the environment as a *single cognitive system*.
	- **Simple embodied cognition** = "our cognitive systems are designed to operate on inputs from a physical world."
	- **Medium embodied cognition** = "the states of the world and our bodies shape cognition in a fundamental way."
	- **Radical embodied cognition** = "the mind cannot be meaningfully studied in isolation from the physical world."
- **Modal representations** = semantic representations that are tied to sensory and motor information.
- **Representation-hungry** = a system that maintains complex internal states and performs "offline" computations.
- **Dynamical coupling** = the ongoing interaction between a system and its environment, where the system repeatedly makes simple computations by observing the world.
- **Actionist robotics** = also **situated** or **behavioral robotics**; making robots with many *interacting behavioral units* that constantly respond to the environment; rather than robots that maintain representational states, which allow them to form detailed internal models and multi-step plans.
- **Social cognition** = collective behaviors that arise from a group of minds as the "basic unit" of cognition.

## Asimov's Laws of Robotics

1. A robot may not injure a human being, or allow a human being to come to harm through inaction.
2. A robot must obey the orders giving it by human beings, except when such orders would conflict with the First Law.
3. A robot must protect its own existence, so long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.
4.

## Study questions

#### Lecture
- Why is robotics difficult, according to **Moravec's paradox**?
- How does the **embodied cognition** approach differ from the traditional cognitive approach? In particular, what is the role of the environment compared with the (natural or artificial) mind?
- What is the difference between **simple**, medium, and **radical** embodied cognition approaches?
- How are **modal representations** studied in humans?
- What are the key differences between **dynamically coupled** and **representation-hungry** systems?
- According to roboticist Rodney Brooks, what is the key principle of **actionist/behavioral/situated robotics**?
- What are **Asimov's laws of robotics** for robot morality?
