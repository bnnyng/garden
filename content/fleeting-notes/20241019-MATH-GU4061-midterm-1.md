- [x] Go over [[Complex numbers, conjugates, and absolute value|complex conjugation]], multiplication of complex numbers, shortcuts (make flashcard)
- [ ] Go over all significant proofs discussed in class
	- [x] [[(Theorem) Heine-Borel|Heine-Borel theorem]]
	- [x] [[(Theorem) Bolzano-Weierstrass|Bolzano-Weierstrass]]
	- [ ] Set is [[Open sets|open]] iff complement is [[Closed sets, closures, and dense subsets|closed]]
	- [x] LPC $\implies$ SC
- [ ] Additional proofs to replicate
	- [ ] Convergence in metric space implies bounded
- [ ] Go over homework problems (solutions?)
	- [ ] 2.7 – Showing that $\sqrt 3$ is not rational by showing the sets of numbers greater/less than it have no sup/inf
	- [ ] 3.1 – Convexity
	- [ ] 3.2 – Weird bijections to show countability
	- [ ] 3.5 – $\partial A = \overline A \backslash A^\circ = \overline A \cap X \backslash A^\circ$ which is the same as $\overline A \cap \overline{X \backslash A}$. Upshot: the complement of the interior is equal to the closure of the complement of the whole set! 
	- [ ] 3.8 – Compact iff LPC for $\mathbb R^n$, true for any metric space
	- [ ] 4.1 – Cantor set
	- [ ] 4.7 – Monotone convergence


- General questions
	- Do we have to memorize things like [[Order relations on sets and fields|order relation axioms]]?
	- What is the importance of convex sets (HW 3.1)?
	- What is the usefulness of separability (i.e., countable dense subset)? Equivalent characterization of **separability**: there exists a sequence of elements such that every non-empty open subset contains at least one element of the sequence?
	- What is limit superior and limit inferior? 
	- What makes LPC $\implies$ compact for *metric spaces* in particular?
