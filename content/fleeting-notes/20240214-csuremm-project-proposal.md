>_Submit a proposal of up to two pages outlining a real-world problem you wish to address. Your write-up should encompass a brief background, your research motivation, one or two proposed research questions, and a minimum of two peer-reviewed references. Evaluation of proposals will focus on the merit of the research question and the feasibility of the proposed project, irrespective of the chosen topic area. The decision to pursue this research during the program will be made collaboratively by you and your team during the first week of the program._

# Notes

## Mathematical modeling and program overview

- Modeling strategy examples
	- Continuous modeling problems (e.g., dynamics of a plant community when exposed to drought): cellular automata, partial differential equations, existing predator-prey equations
- Past project examples
	- Computational model for the spread of the tau protein in Alzheimer’s, improved existing model to account for neuronal death and structural connectivity parameters
	- Sentiment analysis and time series data modeling for stock price prediction
	- Crypto mining simulation
	- (Data) “Impact of increasing climate change-induced natural disasters on school enrollment/child marriage rates in developed vs. developing countries; processed global-scale data sets and performed multivariable regression analysis using the NumPy and Pandas Python libraries”
	- Optimal travel path to exoplanets based on Earth Similarity Index
	- Policy headline sentiment vs. index fund performance
	- Progression of metastatic breast cancer
	- NLP and statistical analysis to evaluate levels of gender bias amongst different organizations—tone weights using sentiment analysis

- Jumping off point with Wikipedia’s [computational cognitive science page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_cognition), see “External Links” for labs of interest
	- [[Tenenbaum, Josh|Josh Tenenbaum]]’s [Computational Cognitive Science Lab](https://cocosci.mit.edu/) at MIT
		- Mathematical modeling tools “drawn chiefly from Bayesian statistics and probability theory, but also from geometry, graph theory, and linear algebra.”
	- Gureckis’ [Computation and Cognition Lab](https://gureckislab.org/research.html) at NYU’s CDS
		- Might actually be worth reaching out for SRI funding sponsorship
	- Griffiths’ [Computational Cognitive Science Lab](https://cocosci.princeton.edu/index.php) at Princeton
	- [Computation and Cognition Lab](https://cocolab.stanford.edu/) at Stanford
	- Also, Lake’s [Human and Machine Learning Lab](https://lake-lab.github.io/projects/) at NYU
- Looked at free energy principle – out of my depth
- Go through possible Readwise queue
