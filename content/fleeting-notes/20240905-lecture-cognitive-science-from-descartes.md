# Lecture: An Overview of Cognitive Science from Descartes
---

Descartes is seen as the beginning of modern philosophy due to his proposal of a new *theory of everything* after the 17th century Scientific Revolution. While Aristotle focused on defining *why* things happen through causes, Descartes focused on determining *how* things happen with mechanical [[All models are wrong, but some are useful|models]]: “The only valid explanations are those that specify mechanisms based on geometric contact forces.”

## Descartes (1596 – 1650)

- Descartes is often seen as the “beginning of modern philosophy” because he was contemporaneous with the beginning of “modernity,” particularly the 17th century scientific revolution.
	- Previously, the dominant **theory of everything** came from Aristotle. When Aristotelean philosophy fell, Descartes proposed a new grand theory.
- Much of modern thought is now a reaction to Descartes’ “original sin” and influence.

## Aristotle (384 – 322)

- Aristotle’s ontology, or theory of being, held that everything was matter shaped by form.
	- There exists a hierarchy of being from simple matter to more complex forms.
- Aristotle’s epistemology, or theory of knowledge, held that the best way to understand something was to understand its *essential* form.
	- Scientific knowledge is obtained by defining a thing’s fundamental essence.
	- Related: Aristotle’s four causes.

## 18th Century Enlightenment Propaganda

- Francis Bacon (1561 – 1626) proposed that science should be about producing *something artificial*: techne (skill), art, and craft.
	- Compare to Aristotle: craft, or production of artificial goods (e.g., technology) is different from doing “natural philosophy.”
	- “Knowledge is power” refers to the belief that the ability to produce technology using scientific knowledge indicates its truth. 
- In modern science, natural philosophy (science) and techne (technology) justify each other in a [[Self-reference|self-referential]] loop:
	1. Natural philosophy is able to produce techne because its true.
	2. Natural philosophy is true because it produces techne.
- #open-question Is this self-reference problematic? Does scientific progress lead to technological progress, or vice versa?
	- If your science aims to make accurate statements about “reality” (e.g., an external ground truth), you need an external measure.

## Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence

- The relationship between cognitive science and artificial intelligence is an example of the self-reference between natural philosophy and techne: cognitive science aims to understand intelligence, while artificial intelligence aims to build a working model of it.
	- At the same time, building computational models gives scientists an object of study.
	- “Psychology is not scientific until cognitive science.”

## Descartes’ Interactionist Substance Dualism

- **Substance dualism** = there is a mind that is a separate *substance* from the body, which is a machine governed by physical laws (in particular, involuntary bodily responses called **reflex arcs** that are triggered by external stimuli).
	- The mind is non-material and without spatial dimensions, the body is material and exists in physical space.
	- Compare to **epiphenomenalism** = similar to substance dualism, but the mind doesn’t “do the thinking” and instead floats freely above the body as an existing separate soul.
- The required harmony between mind and body is a result of or due to God’s benevolence.
