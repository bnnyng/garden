# Nuances to Nature vs. Nurture

*Response to [[@1994jackendoff]], Ch. 1-2.*

One idea that stood out to me is Jackendoff's claim that the physical substrate of Universal Grammar must be encoded over evolutionary timescales (my phrasing). Jackendoff also acknowledges that the "innate part" of language is a combination of "special purpose endowment for language" and "general properties of the mind." I am not convinced that "special purpose endowment for language" could be genetically encoded, and I believe that evolution only develops the "general properties of the mind." I'm partial to Cormac McCarthy's argument in his essay “[[@2017mccarthy|The Kekulé Problem]]“, that the key to language is simply that "one thing can be another thing." I think that there is nothing distinguished about language compared to other human mental activities that involve recursion and self-reference in some formal system (e.g., mathematics, music). Most of my knowledge is pre-linguistic, and I am only able to parse a small subset of that thought into language—and the statements I do produce are extremely uninformative compared to the representation in my mind. On that note, people are not actually nearly as grammatical as Jackendoff assumes: [Bergey and Dedeo (2024)Links to an external site.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08890) showed that natural conversations have information density of a meager 13 bits/second. This result seems like it would support a "poverty of the stimulus" argument, but I interpret this as indication that highly structured, grammatical language is actually extremely effortful and somewhat unintuitive for us to produce; moreover, we don't actually need it to effectively communicate with each other.

# The Rise of Modern Linguistics

*Response to [[@1994jackendoff]], Ch. 3.*

At the end of the chapter, Jackendoff points out that if the UG understanding of language learning—that is, via active construction of principles that transform information from the environment, which itself is an ability that comes from both environmental influence (nurture) and genetic heritage (nature)—is a model for more general human learning, then people would learn best by engaging creatively with an environment in a way that “constructs knowledge in his or her own mind.” (I believe the notion that students actively construct knowledge through experiences is, unsurprisingly, called **constructivism**. This contrasts with the standard **transmission model of education** with a “transmitting” teacher and passively absorptive students.) This theme reminds me of a short story by Ted Chiang called “The Lifecycle of Software Objects,” in which “digients,” or digital entities, are virtual pet-like agents that eventually develop greater intelligence and consciousness. Universal Grammar has interesting implications for engineering or artificially evolving intelligence; it suggests that some form of embodied life experience precedes the development of complex behaviors, and that this life experience is incompressible to a transmission from teacher to student. I speculate that individual knowledge includes both life experience and memory, and I take the latter to be information that *can* be compressed, whether in the brain, culture, tradition, Plato’s notion of an immortal soul in the Phaedo, DNA, etc. Life experience includes the knowledge of how to act upon memory.
