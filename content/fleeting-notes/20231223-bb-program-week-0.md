>[!example] Week 0 intention
>Giving myself the best chance of success by making (small and big) tweaks to my life and mindset.

# Review

> What were my biggest wins from last week?

- I met with friends on Tuesday evening, pushing myself to go out even when I was tired. Turns out, no one expects me to be at “peak performance” all the time, especially not during a casual hangout, and nothing bad happened! I even introduced some of my closest friends to each other, and they all got along.
- I reached out to Tiffany McDermott, a Barnard alum, to “network.” Even though I had rather professional, dry intentions, I had a lot of fun spending time with her, and our trip to the art museum and then gift shopping was one of the highlights of my week. I hope to meet with her again at this Benjamin Franklin group as well.
- I took a chance to ask Dr. Grace Lindsay for a letter of recommendation for [[20231221-application-santa-fe-institute-undergraduate-research]] and she responded quickly, despite it being the holidays. I am so grateful, and I want to reply as soon as possible!
- I had one night purge-free after a work shift. This is a win because it shows me that I *can* do it.

> What were the 2-3 biggest challenges I experienced?

- Bulimia is still a part of my nighttime routine. I feel like trying to sleep without bulimia is “painful” compared to how easily I drift off when I’m exhausted by a relapse. I now have little patience for the extended ritual of falling asleep, and I’m not sure how to sit with the urges when willpower is low and frustration is high.

> What helped me? What worked to create those successes?

- I let myself be excited about something other than bulimia.
- For the purge-free night, I took my bootleg Contrave. I went through my night routine before letting myself do anything else: taking off and putting away clothes, removing my makeup, brushing teeth, showering as needed. I also did not panic about the thought of experiencing urges, but let myself sit through them. I was also fairly tired, hadn’t had any caffeine that day. 
	- Also, I ate later at night, around 9 PM, due to my work schedule. I didn’t actually eat sufficiently during the day; however, the day afterward I did, and although I relapsed that night, it was not exacerbated by hunger and didn’t feel inevitable.
	- Things I am not sure had an effect: taking a bunch of calming supplements before bed; not being medicated during the day.

> What am I going to *keep* doing?

- Waking up and working as a part of my morning routine, which is when I feel freshest.

> What am I going to *stop* doing?

- I will try to stay caffeine-free so that going to bed is as easy as possible.
- I will stop feeling anxious about urges to binge, and accept them as they come. Feelings are just feelings!

> What am I going to *start* doing?

- Waking up and going to bed at the same time every day.
- Find a more frictionless way to remove my makeup, so I don’t feel the urge to procrastinate my whole night routine by relapsing.
- Filling out my daily log as soon as I wake up.
- Eating consistently throughout the day, as well as closer to bedtime so I am not hungry.
