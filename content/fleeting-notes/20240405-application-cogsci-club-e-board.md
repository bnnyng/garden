>How do you plan to contribute to CU CogSci?  (~200 words)

- Want to represent more of the research dimension, rather than career, because that is what I’m interested in. 
	- Emphasize interdisciplinary nature of cognitive science, bringing interest in from people outside of the major itself – lots of benefit in the collaboration!
	- How to keep people updated on the academic field.
- Contributions
	- Club values of building community – want to connect research oriented folks as well; as mentioned above, interdisciplinary
	- Journal club

I am passionate about showcasing the practical and diverse outcomes of getting a cognitive science degree. I believe the strength of cognitive science is not only its interdisciplinary scope, but also interdisciplinary applications from corporations and industry to academic research. 

As a first-generation student, I lacked a model for pragmatic career possibilities for my cognitive science degree. The Beyond Barnard panel “Career Insights for Cognitive Science majors” (2021) had a significant influence on my professional plans—it was the first time I fully had answers to what one could do with cognitive science in the real world—and I want to contribute by organizing events that could offer similar clarity to my peers and connect them with potential mentors.

Because of my own career goals, I am also interested in more club programming around current cognitive science research, namely starting a journal club (sub-club?). A journal club to keep updated on the academic field is a necessary complement to our official coursework with “canonical texts”; because our program is so new, we do not yet have faculty that capture the entire scope of state-of-the-art research. I envision a low-stakes discussion group that will generate interest not only among the people in the major, but also build interdisciplinary community by appealing to people in related degrees like computer science, neuroscience, and psychology. By connecting research-oriented folks across majors, we build a foundation for exchanging knowledge and opportunities in the sciences.

>What skills and/or previous experience make you a good fit for this role? Please describe any related experience (~100 words)
- For journal club – highly involved in related research, as well as having been in two journal clubs at different institutions (one where I was the only undergraduate). Know how they should be run! Also have been to research symposiums, know where to look
- For VP alumni relations 
	- Fostering relationships: strong networking and communication skills in the research area (able to get positions with limited experience by having in-person communication and also writing coherent, thoughtful research proposals)

Although I do not have direct experiences with organizing career panels, I have organized similar events in the past. While serving as the president of my high school LGBTQ+ club, I planned annual panels for students to share their experiences in a school-wide assembly; this involved reaching out to volunteers, advertising and generating excitement for the event, and frequent contact with school administration for the assembly logistics. During my time at the University of Washington’s computational neuroscience journal club, I reached out to the first author of the paper I was presenting and arranged for them to speak to the club in person. 

I have also been a member of three different journal clubs, all organized by professors and primarily including graduate students: one that exclusively involved people in my lab, one that was loosely organized but accepted people from anywhere in the department, and one that was highly structured with scheduled presentations. I plan to evaluate the benefits and limitations of these different approaches to determine the most approachable structure for our club.

>(answer this question if you want to create a new program) Propose to lead your own program within the club! Tell us what you would want to create within the Cog Sci community. Please be as specific as possible.

- Journal club
	- We get a lot of the canonical texts in Intro Cogsci, but it is difficult to find out about the current research on one’s own, especially because CU’s program is so new and associated faculty do not encompass the entire scope of SOTA research.
	- Further, not a lot of resources for people who want to do research as opposed to career.
	- Complements cogsci lunch + lecture series by expanding breadth, perhaps not depth
- Meeting not more frequently than every other week, but would depend on interest/attendance.
- Entice people with snacks/dinner, make the reading optional.
- Model after compneuro journal club at UW, highly successful
	- Running list of paper suggestions, decide on one person who wants to present (or I’ll just do it if the person suggesting doesn’t want to—that way, lower commitment barrier), also responsible for things like possibly reaching out to the author to share about their own paper
	- Send out a poll for next time OR during the meeting? Want it to be open to people just popping in, so schedule should be available publicly

I envision the journal club program to be a sort of discussion group that meets not more frequently than every other week, depending on interest. This group would complement the departmental lunch + lecture series by emphasizing breadth (rather than depth of an academic speaking of their own research focus), and be open to people of all majors. I want the group to have a low barrier for entry to increase attendance, so although we will focus on one paper/theme per meeting, any readings will be optional; to further entice people, we can serve snacks (thinking about how the Undergraduate Math Society catered dinners are wildly popular among students of all departments, haha).

The structure takes heavy inspiration from the UW compneuro journal club: we will keep a running list of paper/topic suggestions for those who care, and offer members the option of presenting an overview themselves (also giving the option to showcase their own research); if the suggester doesn’t want to present, I or another student could volunteer. The presenter also has the option of inviting the author themselves to speak. I am unsure of the best way to decide on the topic for the following meeting, whether it should be done in person (would probably be best with consistent attendees) or on an online poll.
