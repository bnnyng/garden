# Overview

üìÜ **Deadline: January 11, 2024**

>The SFI Undergraduate Complexity Research (UCR) program is a 10-week residential experience in complex systems science. Students can select from a menu of projects, or develop a project¬†in collaboration with their mentor(s). Students learn how to combine theory, methods, and data from the physical, natural, and social sciences to ask big questions about real-world complex systems using the rigorous methods employed at SFI. Through a series of seminars and workshops, students enhance their skills as researchers and prepare for the next steps in their academic and professional journeys.

>Program Goals
>- Explore new ideas through an independent transdisciplinary research project, guided by an SFI mentor. Read about past projects on our Projects page
>- Develop a deeper understanding of complex systems research through discussions and seminars.
>- Become a part of the SFI research network and connect with new colleagues and collaborators.
>- Build technical and professional skills; explore diverse future career opportunities.
>- Join a small, collegial, and enthusiastic UCR community who help each other succeed ‚Äì even after the end of summer.

# Essay questions

## Complex systems

> Please briefly discuss what appeals to you about the study of complex systems and/or the research philosophy of the Santa Fe Institute. You can get a brief overview of SFI here: https://santafe.edu/about/overview (max. half page)

## Topics

>Please describe two scientific questions or research projects that interest you as well as your general idea of how you might address these. For both, provide enough background and detail to convey (1) the importance of the question or project or what interests you about it, and (2) the logic of your approach. (max. one page)
>
>Note: These topics are not necessarily research projects that you would pursue during the UCR program at SFI. Project development is a collaborative process between the student and their mentor.

## Collaborative work

>The SFI UCR program requires collaboration. Please describe an experience with collaboration, whether in college or elsewhere, and what you learned from that experience about how to work effectively as part of a team.

- Restaurant work at Stateside
	- Contrast with other experiences in academic research: how am I using the same skills, but distilled and condensed?
	- Fast, working under pressure
	- Role as host is to seat guests, then assist servers
		- Flexibility, adapting to various tasks that are thrown to me, learning quickly
		- Other tasks include: running food and clearing tables, watering guests, keeping servers updated about reservation times and reservation details
		- Communication is key: while in past work I could get away with dialed in, deep independent work, here that would cause the system to collapse
	- Need to stay accountable and make reports to others, letting BOH know about the remaining reservations; my word decides when they start ‚Äúbreaking down‚Äù the kitchen, essentially when everyone gets to go home
		- The first time I forgot to do this, messed up the schedule and also confused the expo, who had to send food to a table that was supposedly not arrived

# Notes

## [Thirty years of undergraduate research](https://www.santafe.edu/news-center/news/thirty-years-undergraduate-research)

>‚ÄúMy summer at SFI was amazing: the environment was small, welcoming, and vibrant. I was exposed to ideas across many fields, ranging from economics and anthropology to biology and mathematics, each with their own technical languages albeit with common concepts and ideas,‚Äù says Mahesh Mahanthappa (‚Äò95), professor of chemical engineering and materials science at the University of Minnesota. ‚ÄúThis forced me to learn how to communicate across disciplines and by using analogies (sometimes anthropomorphic) ‚Äî a skill that I value to this day.‚Äù

- Interdisciplinary study is very intriguing and important to me! Analogy-making is something I‚Äôve always been interested in, at least in the realm of cognitive science.
	- Example: analogy between linguistic and mathematical communities, learning; default mode network, creativity, and the contemplative life vs. what is true intelligence?

>What students valued then as now is the independence afforded by SFI‚Äôs program, the lack of hierarchy at SFI in general, and the chance to discuss ideas with everyone.

- ‚ÄúI want to do science like that!‚Äù is exactly the thought that struck me.

## [Current research](https://santafe.edu/research/overview)

>Our¬†scientific¬†‚Äúkingdom‚Äù is¬†[complexity](https://www.santafe.edu/what-is-complex-systems-science).¬†Our¬†‚Äúspecies‚Äù are individual research papers.¬†Somewhere in the middle of this taxonomy are the¬†‚Äúfamily"-level research¬†[themes](https://www.santafe.edu/research/themes)¬†and "genus"-level¬†[projects](https://www.santafe.edu/research/projects)¬†which draw together large networks of¬†[researchers](https://www.santafe.edu/people/type/researcher)¬†in our¬†resident¬†and external faculty and define new frontiers in scientific understanding.

### Complex intelligence: natural, artificial, and collective

#### [Artificial intelligence: Foundations to frontiers](https://santafe.edu/research/projects/artificial-intelligence-foundations-frontiers)


#### [A theory of embodied intelligence](https://santafe.edu/research/projects/theory-of-embodied-intelligence)

>We are building a theoretical framework that will guide the creation of artificial agents that adjust their neural networks (brains) to feedback from their bodies and surroundings -- in essence to learn how to navigate their surroundings.

>Although the field of AI is currently dominated by the pre-programming paradigm, where the robot is instructed to perform specific behaviors, we believe the notion of embodiment can help us evolve truly intelligent artificial systems.

- Related to my fascination with [[an-embodied-cognitive-science]]!
- Interestingly, reminds me of [[on-proof-and-progress-in-mathematics]]; indeed, the four-color graph thing is referenced in the [‚ÄúLimits‚Äù theme page](https://santafe.edu/research/themes/limits)
	- Can we consider computational tools to be a part of our cognition? Intuitively, people reject this. So for body and environment to feel integrated into cognition, we still need to have a sort of conscious understanding at the knowledge level.
## [Past projects](https://www.santafe.edu/engage/learn/projects)

- Machine learning and artificial intelligence (‚≠ê= Melanie Mitchell as mentor)
	- Causal reasoning in spiking neural networks
		- ‚ÄúIn this study, we explored the use of Spiking Neural Networks (SNN), specifically the Leaky Integrate and Fire (LIF) model, in modeling causal reasoning.‚Äù
		- ‚ÄúThis research could potentially enhance our understanding of the limitations of machine learning models in inferring causality. Furthermore, by examining the spike pattern in SNNs, we can identify the information processing correlates that allow the model to make certain predictions.‚Äù
	- Program synthesis for 1D spatial reasoning ‚≠ê
		- ‚ÄúCapturing abstract conceptual reasoning is an unsolved problem in artificial intelligence. Recently, large language models have caused a stir in the field with their ability to solve requiring reason by using generated text. We seek to find out to what extent LLMs have abstract reasoning capabilities and generative problem solving skills.‚Äù
	- Exploring the depths of concept representation in transformer models
		- ‚ÄúWe can ask the question of how and where in transformer models abstract concept representations are emerging, and whether these representations have similar attributes to those of humans. We probe the various hierarchical layers in the transformer model in order to analyze which layers are most sensitive to which kinds of concepts. Understanding the layers of the transformer as corresponding to a hierarchy of abstract transformations of word embeddings, we can elucidate the process by which abstract concepts are encoded and decoded in the model by analyzing their numerical representations.‚Äù
	- Visual analogy-making with LLMs ‚≠ê
		- ‚ÄúIn this project, we investigate whether GPT-3 models can perform better on the Concept ARC through applied language. More specifically, can adding verbal instructions to each problem improve model performance?‚Äù
	- Genetic Algorithms: Computation, Ecology, and Entropy ‚≠ê
		- ‚ÄúThis project aims to test this hypothesis by using neural networks and the MNIST dataset to understand how spatial coevolution can outperform other training methods. Specifically, I plan to run a multi-fold experiment: (1) evolutionary training of neural networks in a non-spatial setting, (2) evolutionary training of neural networks in a spatial configuration, (3) coevolving neural networks and MNIST data in a spatial configuration, and (4) extending to GANs in a spatial configuration.‚Äù
	- Spatial evolutionary learning ‚≠ê
		- ‚ÄúThis project aims to optimize a FNN using a GA instead of back-propagation (BP) and a grid structure which contains neural networks (NNs) in each cell. Each NN is tasked with correctly identifying the examples in the MNIST handwritten digit data set.‚Äù
	- How does the brain compute? Building upon Assembly Calculus ‚≠ê
		- ‚ÄúIn this paper, we modify an assumption of Assembly Calculus by changing its base graph model, propose how interactions of assemblies may evolve over varying time scales, include language experiments that serve as a useful jumping board to extend Assembly Calculus, and suggest what learning via assemblies may involve.‚Äù
