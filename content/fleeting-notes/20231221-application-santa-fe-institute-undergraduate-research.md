## Complex systems

> Please briefly discuss what appeals to you about the study of complex systems and/or the research philosophy of the Santa Fe Institute. You can get a brief overview of SFI here: https://santafe.edu/about/overview (max. half page)

- I have been interested in studying complex systems, but I didn’t have a name for it until reading complexity book
	- My own notetaking style is done in Obsidian, I focus on drawing connections between atomic “permanent notes” – the notion of complexity has always appealed to me, even utilized in my own cognition
	- Approach to how I manage information is complexity (and embodiment? Complex systems seeks to find an answer)
- I like the interdisciplinary approach, hierarchical – cognitive science is already interdisciplinary, but a higher level of analysis offers clarity (and in a way, our cognition encompasses it all, so it is all very meta!)
	- All my research experience in the past has been highly specified, leading me to jump from project to project in order to explore more. At SFI, it’s all in one place
- Questions about complexity can seem vague and fantastical, but SFI does rigorous research
	- Particularly appealing to me as I came from psychology, with “replication crisis”
	- There is constant reflection on the scientific method itself when operating at such a general level (discovered from reading workshop reports)
- I study cognitive science and mathematics – both are deeply tied to the notion of complex systems
- Approach complexity from all points of view

```
	I currently study mathematics and cognitive science. These always seemed vaguely related, but I struggled to articulate what similarity made me interested in both until I read Complexity: A Guided Tour. In particular, the very understanding of mathematics (i.e., building mental representations of complicated mathematical concepts) must be drawn from a complex network of collaborators, lectures, and textbooks, not to mention the difficulty of communicating original research—a novel cognitive process, unlike scientific discoveries which clarify existing phenomena. Cognitive science offers empirical methods for understanding complex cognition; math offers hands-on experience at its limits.
```
## Topics

>Please describe two scientific questions or research projects that interest you as well as your general idea of how you might address these. For both, provide enough background and detail to convey (1) the importance of the question or project or what interests you about it, and (2) the logic of your approach. (max. one page)
>
>Note: These topics are not necessarily research projects that you would pursue during the UCR program at SFI. Project development is a collaborative process between the student and their mentor.

- Embodied cognition – how people use their surroundings as knowledge, how cognition is scaffolded by our environmental circumstances (social structure, language)
	- “How does learning happen?”, a question asked throughout history; Augustine said it was Jesus Christ, Socrates said it was the soul.
	- Modern version of the soul is human culture, the wealth of collective experience
	- Try to operationalize knowledge; example, implementing a “commonsense” reasoning re: AI2, or 
	- Intelligence seems to come from a higher-level ability to select from lower-level skills, as a hierarchy. It follows that we should test different biases of the higher-level ability
- Theory of mind
	- Non-verbal theory of mind, like an infant

```
	Embodied cognition investigates how cognitive processes are augmented by being situated in an external environment. Here, “environment” includes: rich sensory data from interacting with the physical world; intangible “scaffolding” like language, culture, and social connections; and the timescale over which learning occurs. All biological general intelligence, meaning agents capable of using higher-order cognition to solve problems, is embodied in innumerable ways. This has promising implications for developing AI systems. For example, Jaques et al. (2009) showed that a reinforcement learning (RL)  framework with “intrinsic social motivation” (agents rewarded themselves for influencing other agents) led to higher collective rewards in a “social dilemma” game, operationalizing the effects of both implicit and explicit social communication. The Allen Institute’s RAINIER model optimized for “knowledge introspection” and was able to respond to “commonsense” questions with relevant knowledge, similar to the shared cultural environment that leads to human common sense. 
```

```
	An important mark of general intelligence—at both individual and collective levels—is the higher-order ability to select the appropriate solution or heuristic for a problem from a wide variety of options. In contrast, traditional machine learning algorithms optimize for and can exceed human performance on domain-specific tasks like chess, but cannot generalize skills to new problems. Intelligent agents like humans leverage a cognitive system with many interacting components, whether that be different functional modules in the brain or other agents in an extended social network. 

```
## Collaborative work

>The SFI UCR program requires collaboration. Please describe an experience with collaboration, whether in college or elsewhere, and what you learned from that experience about how to work effectively as part of a team.

- Restaurant work at Stateside
	- Contrast with other experiences in academic research: how am I using the same skills, but distilled and condensed?
	- Fast, working under pressure
	- Role as host is to seat guests, then assist servers
		- Flexibility, adapting to various tasks that are thrown to me, learning quickly
		- Other tasks include: running food and clearing tables, watering guests, keeping servers updated about reservation times and reservation details
		- Communication is key: while in past work I could get away with dialed in, deep independent work, here that would cause the system to collapse
	- Need to stay accountable and make reports to others, letting BOH know about the remaining reservations; my word decides when they start “breaking down” the kitchen, essentially when everyone gets to go home
		- The first time I forgot to do this, messed up the schedule and also confused the expo, who had to send food to a table that was supposedly not arrived
- Working at Spec, both as copy editor and project designer
	- Difference was that copy editor did not have any “take-homes” and involved heavy in person collaboration, project designer was the opposite
	- Emphasize communication, knowledge exchange
	- Miffed at first that although website was my idea, I wasn’t privileged with credit acknowledgement in the process
		- Realized that ideas were great but don’t matter unless a team brought them to fruition – after the individualistic impact I had as a copy editor, was a learning experience

# Notes

## [Thirty years of undergraduate research](https://www.santafe.edu/news-center/news/thirty-years-undergraduate-research)

>“My summer at SFI was amazing: the environment was small, welcoming, and vibrant. I was exposed to ideas across many fields, ranging from economics and anthropology to biology and mathematics, each with their own technical languages albeit with common concepts and ideas,” says Mahesh Mahanthappa (‘95), professor of chemical engineering and materials science at the University of Minnesota. “This forced me to learn how to communicate across disciplines and by using analogies (sometimes anthropomorphic) — a skill that I value to this day.”

- Interdisciplinary study is very intriguing and important to me! Analogy-making is something I’ve always been interested in, at least in the realm of cognitive science.
	- Example: analogy between linguistic and mathematical communities, learning; default mode network, creativity, and the contemplative life vs. what is true intelligence?

>What students valued then as now is the independence afforded by SFI’s program, the lack of hierarchy at SFI in general, and the chance to discuss ideas with everyone.

- “I want to do science like that!” is exactly the thought that struck me.

## [Current research](https://santafe.edu/research/overview)

>Our scientific “kingdom” is [complexity](https://www.santafe.edu/what-is-complex-systems-science). Our “species” are individual research papers. Somewhere in the middle of this taxonomy are the “family"-level research [themes](https://www.santafe.edu/research/themes) and "genus"-level [projects](https://www.santafe.edu/research/projects) which draw together large networks of [researchers](https://www.santafe.edu/people/type/researcher) in our resident and external faculty and define new frontiers in scientific understanding.

### Complex intelligence: natural, artificial, and collective

#### [Artificial intelligence: Foundations to frontiers](https://santafe.edu/research/projects/artificial-intelligence-foundations-frontiers)


#### [A theory of embodied intelligence](https://santafe.edu/research/projects/theory-of-embodied-intelligence)

>We are building a theoretical framework that will guide the creation of artificial agents that adjust their neural networks (brains) to feedback from their bodies and surroundings -- in essence to learn how to navigate their surroundings.

>Although the field of AI is currently dominated by the pre-programming paradigm, where the robot is instructed to perform specific behaviors, we believe the notion of embodiment can help us evolve truly intelligent artificial systems.

- Related to my fascination with [[literature-notes/1999-clark-an-embodied-cognitive-science]]!
- Interestingly, reminds me of [[1994-thurston-on-proof-and-progress-in-mathematics]]; indeed, the four-color graph thing is referenced in the [“Limits” theme page](https://santafe.edu/research/themes/limits)
	- Can we consider computational tools to be a part of our cognition? Intuitively, people reject this. So for body and environment to feel integrated into cognition, we still need to have a sort of conscious understanding at the knowledge level.
## [Past projects](https://www.santafe.edu/engage/learn/projects)

- Machine learning and artificial intelligence (⭐= Melanie Mitchell as mentor)
	- Causal reasoning in spiking neural networks
		- “In this study, we explored the use of Spiking Neural Networks (SNN), specifically the Leaky Integrate and Fire (LIF) model, in modeling causal reasoning.”
		- “This research could potentially enhance our understanding of the limitations of machine learning models in inferring causality. Furthermore, by examining the spike pattern in SNNs, we can identify the information processing correlates that allow the model to make certain predictions.”
	- Program synthesis for 1D spatial reasoning ⭐
		- “Capturing abstract conceptual reasoning is an unsolved problem in artificial intelligence. Recently, large language models have caused a stir in the field with their ability to solve requiring reason by using generated text. We seek to find out to what extent LLMs have abstract reasoning capabilities and generative problem solving skills.”
	- Exploring the depths of concept representation in transformer models
		- “We can ask the question of how and where in transformer models abstract concept representations are emerging, and whether these representations have similar attributes to those of humans. We probe the various hierarchical layers in the transformer model in order to analyze which layers are most sensitive to which kinds of concepts. Understanding the layers of the transformer as corresponding to a hierarchy of abstract transformations of word embeddings, we can elucidate the process by which abstract concepts are encoded and decoded in the model by analyzing their numerical representations.”
	- Visual analogy-making with LLMs ⭐
		- “In this project, we investigate whether GPT-3 models can perform better on the Concept ARC through applied language. More specifically, can adding verbal instructions to each problem improve model performance?”
	- Genetic Algorithms: Computation, Ecology, and Entropy ⭐
		- “This project aims to test this hypothesis by using neural networks and the MNIST dataset to understand how spatial coevolution can outperform other training methods. Specifically, I plan to run a multi-fold experiment: (1) evolutionary training of neural networks in a non-spatial setting, (2) evolutionary training of neural networks in a spatial configuration, (3) coevolving neural networks and MNIST data in a spatial configuration, and (4) extending to GANs in a spatial configuration.”
	- Spatial evolutionary learning ⭐ (training NNs using a genetic algorithm)
		- “This project aims to optimize a FNN using a GA instead of back-propagation (BP) and a grid structure which contains neural networks (NNs) in each cell. Each NN is tasked with correctly identifying the examples in the MNIST handwritten digit data set.”
	- How does the brain compute? Building upon Assembly Calculus ⭐
		- “In this paper, we modify an assumption of Assembly Calculus by changing its base graph model, propose how interactions of assemblies may evolve over varying time scales, include language experiments that serve as a useful jumping board to extend Assembly Calculus, and suggest what learning via assemblies may involve.”
