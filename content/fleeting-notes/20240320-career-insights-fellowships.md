When did you become interested in this process?
- Elle (Fulbright language teaching) – March of junior year, after seeing a similar information session; go onto Fulbright website and look into experiences; wrote applications in summer before senior year
- Nathalie (Fulbright research) – Began at the end of summer before senior year, “couldn’t think of a research project” until then (!!)
- Cassandra (Fulbright research) – Began application in July before senior year, challenging for scientific research!; cold emailed and asked for connections from research advisors

What have you learned? How did Barnard prepare you for your fellowship? 
- Nathalie – Had a hard adjustment with how self-directed her research was
	- Something that I've gotten used to in my gap year!
- In meeting, will be asked examples of flexibility, community engagement, and open-mindedness.

What piece of advice would you give current Barnard students who are thinking of going through the process?
- Skills like languages, project management, and cultural exchange

What to do for back-ups?
- Apply for jobs as if you won't get the scholarship, but not necessarily grad school?
- Can also possibly apply to grad school in the senior year and then defer for a year; can possibly also have a GRFP at the same time

How do you ask for a recommendation?
- After completing an experience, IMMEDIATELY ask if they would be willing to be a reference in the future!
