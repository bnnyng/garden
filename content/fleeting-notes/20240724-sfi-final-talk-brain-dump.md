# Outline

#### Introduction

#### Describing the dataset

- Deliverables
	- [ ] Count number of comments in each project

#### “Zooming in” with fine-grained examples

- Deliverables
	- [ ] Type-set equation for “diversity”
	- [x] Radar plots for semantic topics with labels (report mapping)
	- [ ] Close analysis of certain points in diversity-over-time plots – example comments, word clouds of terms used
	- [ ] Horizontal dendrogram
	- [ ] (Optional) Representation for “highlight” comments in diversity over time plots
	- [ ] (Optional) Comment length vs. entropy correlations

- Plot descriptions
	- Radar plots – tended to move to new techniques throughout, not really any backtracking. However, general topics were repeated (but still distinguishable?)

#### “Zooming out”

- Deliverables
	- [x] Radar plots for the “cognitive profiles” of each polymath project
	- [x] Assign topic labels for coarse-grained profile
	- [ ] Look at specific peaks in fine-grained profile for all projects, show example words
	- [ ] (Optional) Look at specific peaks in P1 Gowers’ profile
- Current stage – balancing interpretability and insights
	- Many of these are overlapping and not clearly distinguished! Our next steps will be to better characterize these topics

#### (Optional) Sneak peeks

- Deliverables
	- [ ] Type-set equation for novelty/transience
	- [x] Novelty/transience plots for top users 
	- [ ] Novelty/transience plots for highlight comments

#### Future directions

- What can the data we have tell us about the different guiding questions?
	- How do people work together?
		- Social dynamics – do people fall into different roles? Who has the most resonant comments (e.g., are they always the most well-known)? 
			- **Novelty, transience, and resonance**
- Explanation and shared mental models
- What does the advent of automated proving tell us about why we do math? – see new DeepMind paper
	- Can connect to idea of AI reaching human-level excellence; will everything end up being pure recreation?
	- Mathematicians report certain aspects that determine their “understanding” and satisfaction with a proof; the “cognitive moves” produce a more comprehensive, fine-grained understanding of what people are feeling
- Humor elements
	- Chaos vs. order muppets
- [[20240802-a-potential-talk-narrative]]
- Plots to report
	- Hierarchy overview, give comment examples
	- Reduce hierarchies to the most interesting/comprehensible ones!
	- Hierarchical reduction is based on “do these topics look similar in the words they use” ([[2024-08-01]])
