## Draft

Dear CSC team,

I am writing to express my interest in becoming a Computing Fellow in Fall 2024. I believe the role is a perfect match for my existing skills in programming and data science, my STEM research background, and my passion for peer and self education.

My experience with data management and modeling, including classical machine learning and deep neural networks, allows me to apply computational methods across a wide range of problems and STEM disciplines. I have over six years of coding experience and a strong foundation in general programming principles from taking Columbia’s Data Structures & Algorithms. More specifically, as a research assistant at NYU’s Center for Data Science, I used PyTorch to train and analyze both custom and foundation convolutional neural networks on image data, including writing a new “locally connected” layer class for the PyTorch library. Competing in the 2024 Mathematical Contest in Modeling, where teams were challenged to use Wimbledon data to model the flow of play in a tennis game, also gave me extensive experience in manipulating tabular data, applying both frequentist and Bayesian statistical models, and, most importantly, performing error and sensitivity analyses on the results of statistical inference. This summer, I will be studying emergent behavior among agents equipped with social motivation in a multi-agent reinforcement learning setting. Thus, I am prepared to support my peers with Python data analysis and learning algorithms, whether those algorithms are used to draw conclusions from various formats, or are themselves the object of study.

My passion for computational research makes me an ideal Fellow for STEM courses. Beyond just computing, I have a thorough understanding of how data science fits in the scientific process. I believe I would be a particularly effective Fellow when paired with data-driven courses, especially those involving neuroscience domain knowledge, like “Introduction to Computational Thinking” and “Fundamentals in Computational Neuroscience Models.” I am also interested in leading data science CSC seminars, from introductory topics like using Pandas to niche techniques like probabilistic programming.

Finally, participating in research communities has given me experience with peer teaching and effective communication. During poster sessions for Barnard’s Summer Research Institute and NYU’s CDS, I learned to distill highly technical research topics for a general audience and provide accessible answers to questions. Currently, I am a member of the University of Washington’s computational neuroscience journal club, where I am responsible for an hour-long presentation on a research paper each quarter. My comfort with peer teaching in both small groups and seminar-style large audiences will translate well to a Fellow’s pedagogical role.

My interest in scientific research is motivated by my intellectual curiosity and desire to learn new skills, as well as sharing them with others. The Computing Fellow role not only suits my technical background, but also provides a uniquely fulfilling chance to prepare for graduate school teaching responsibilities. I am very excited for this job opportunity, and I thank you for your full consideration.

Best,
Bonnie

## Brainstorm

- What can I contribute?
	- Already very comfortable with Python, would not be hard for me to apply methods to more disciplines; demonstrated that I am a quick learner both in summer program and math modeling workshop
	- Tabular and visual data analysis
	- Interest in AI and machine intelligence – participant in Generative AI learning community, can speak to larger trends in machine learning and artificial intelligence
- What do I hope to gain from this role?
	- Eager to learn about different computational methods, as I see them highly relevant to my future career in research
	- Why interested in pedagogy?
		- Engagement with the academic community in a pedagogical role also relevant to my career goals in academia
		- Want to apply my perspective to pedagogical skills – have always been interested in exposition and passionate about teaching; example is the math essay I did exceptionally well in 
	- Interested in how classrooms engage with emerging technologies like AI, coming from the engineering/fully technical side. I believe that holistic view is necessary for people working in the field, which I intend to do, etc.

## Experiences

**Cover letter**

- Experiences with data management and modeling
	- General programming principles from DS&A
	- Computational neuroscience research at NYU – using convolutional neural networks to investigate the relationship between tuning and gradients [(link to poster](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bonnie-yang-1198a522a/overlay/1635539607457/single-media-viewer/?profileId=ACoAADlwzGUBCZUNpsGfOtRoKv3MDJ7kATp_BBI))
	- 2024 MCM honorable mention
		- Used [Markov chain with Bayesian logistic regression](https://github.com/bnnyng/mcm-2024) to get the transition probabilities (Bayesian obtaining the parameters)
		- Posterior predictive model simulates data (possible score outcomes) by sampling from parameter posteriors, compare to observed values
		- Best practice in model building is to separate training, validation, and test data; 69% accuracy
		- Sensitivity analysis: perturb values for each parameter and assess changes in the posterior distribution to determine which parameter affects the output most
	- Current summer project: computational epistemology of mathematics
		- Ongoing similar project for science science using multi-agent algorithm; agents are individual scientists seeking “ground truth conclusions,” looking at epistemic success using different experimental choice strategies like falsification, confirmation, novelty-seeking
		- May also be instead working on optimizing for the “ground truth” to avoid 
- Familiar with how data science fits into the scientific process
- Peer teaching and effective communication
	- Poster sessions for Barnard’s SRI
	- Current position involves giving flash talks and presenting a seminar at the end of the program, plenty of public speaking tutorials throughout
	- Passionate about teaching when it comes to learning and teaching mathematics, motivating my entire potential project for the summer
## Questions

- What does a typical week look like for a Computing Fellow? Are all the tasks—help room, workshops, and supporting courses—done about equally, or do some Fellows focus on one over the other?
	- *6-8 hours on average, don’t work more; includes weekly meetings.*
	- *Any time spent as a Fellow can be logged for hours.*
	- *Depends on course—can be multiple fellows! If not enough hours, can look for more work.*
- What does training for the position look like? What will Fellows be expected to be able to do at different times?
	- What kind of expectations do you have for how Fellows might develop both technical and “soft” skills while in the position?
	- *First 4-5 meetings are training sessions.*
	- *Anti-racism pedagogy training; pedagogy in general and workshop creation; documentation.*
- What is the most challenging part about being a new Fellow for most people? What do new Fellows tend to not be prepared for?
