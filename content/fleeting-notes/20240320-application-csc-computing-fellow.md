# Overview

[Role description](https://csc.barnard.edu/computing-fellows?mc_cid=2d9a249bc5&mc_eid=6041017bf9)

>Computing Fellows assist in the development of computing-related workshops and other resources and work with specific courses and/or course projects, with a particular focus on helping to develop computational projects and in-class activities. Applicants should have an interest in peer teaching, some experience coding, and most importantly, a strong willingness to learn. Successful candidates will be “attached” to a Barnard course with a computational component, assist faculty and students, and/or develop a workshop related to the topic of the course with assistance from the CSC.
>
>Fellows should have some experience coding and a **strong willingness to learn about computational methods and pedagogy.**

## Activities and responsibilities

>Computing Fellows are expected to be attached to a course or program (like Pixel).  Responsibilities may include:
>- Communicating with instructor(s) in your attached course
>- Communicating with students in your attached course to schedule one-on-one consultation meetings; hosting one-on-one consultation meetings
>- Holding office hours
>- Leading and developing workshop(s) for your attached course or for the CSC
>- Attending regular training meetings
>- Supporting other Computing Fellows as needed

Takeaways: Need strong communication skills, interpersonal skills for peer-to-peer teaching.

>Fellows meetings include a variety of activities and topics, including:
>- Training on pedagogy and the role of the peer fellow
>- Practicing giving feedback in both one-on-one and group settings
>- Leading workshops among your peers
>- Reflecting on the relationships between technology, computation, and society

# Cover letter

## Brainstorm

- What can I contribute?
	- Already very comfortable with Python, would not be hard for me to apply methods to more disciplines; demonstrated that I am a quick learner both in summer program and math modeling workshop
	- Tabular and visual data analysis
	- Interest in AI and machine intelligence – participant in Generative AI learning community, can speak to larger trends in machine learning and artificial intelligence
- What do I hope to gain from this role?
	- Eager to learn about different computational methods, as I see them highly relevant to my future career in research
	- Why interested in pedagogy?
		- Engagement with the academic community in a pedagogical role also relevant to my career goals in academia
		- Want to apply my perspective to pedagogical skills – have always been interested in exposition and passionate about teaching; example is the math essay I did exceptionally well in 
	- Interested in how classrooms engage with emerging technologies like AI, coming from the engineering/fully technical side. I believe that holistic view is necessary for people working in the field, which I intend to do, etc.
