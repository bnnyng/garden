#### Meeting notes

- Most think it’s nice to not give interdisciplinary spiel – but I think that’s the unique and beautiful part!
	-  How to get more people to know about cognitive science? What kind of impression do you want to give them?
- Kick-off event: game night, speed dating
- Next time: for organizational purposes, what sort of resources would be needed to achieve semester goals?
	- How to take initiative, make attainable goals?

#### My goals for the year

>For our first meeting, we will meet each other, welcome our new e-board members, and graph out together what we want to do with the club this year. To prepare, please come with 3 goals you would like to accomplish in your role this year.

1. Find a way for members to interact with the range of current cognitive science research: papers, presentations, interviews, or project-based work (e.g., an undergraduate conference)
	- Could start with a general survey of ideas from the [encyclopedia of cognitive science](https://oecs.mit.edu/)?
	- Alternatively, model something after the “reckless ideas seminar”
	- Take inspiration from [IU undergraduate club](https://beinvolved.indiana.edu/organization/SOCS)
1. Facilitate networking opportunities between students (particularly those interested in graduate-level research) and researchers/PIs in cognitive science
2. Make a space for people to share about their own interests, works-in-progress, and half-baked ideas in cognitive science

#### Marina email

- Four potential directions: papers, presentations, interviews, or project-based work
- What are potential activities related to “academics and research” that people could engage in?
	- Inviting professors and performing informal interviews
	- Starting a podcast
	- Project or goal-driven activity, e.g., and undergraduate cogsci conference

```
Congratulations on getting to run the journal club! This is going to be very fun:)

As someone who lacks experience of the US undergraduate education (Russian education is very different), my advice is somewhat limited. Nevertheless, here are some thoughts: 

1. Here is the most recent encyclopedia of cognitive science if you were looking for more recent state of things in the field: 

[https://oecs.mit.edu/](https://oecs.mit.edu/)

2. IU had a pretty successful cogsci undergraduate club. Most of their meetings were not focused on reading/discussing papers, but they instead invited professors from the university and interviewed them at each meeting:) this could be a more fun & interactive format for you to consider for at least some meetings. Eventually, you might consider the club producing Columbia CogSci podcast which I saw some clubs do as well:) IU’s club served pizza in each meeting which also increased participation haha

3. You might consider, depending on the participants and what they are interested in, to have some project/goal-driven activity. This could be working on a CogSci project together (e.g. replicating one of the foundational cogsci studies) or organizing and planning a Columbia undergraduate cogsci conference — the IU club has done this too. This would be more ambitious and will rely on support from the program and some reliable participants, so it could be something to consider for the next semester.

4. Depending on the amount of initially interested people, for one of the first meetings you might consider some kind of interactive format for people to learn and connect on their shared interests. This could be something like a speed-dating session, or something similar. You can also ask participants what they want to get out of the meetings so that you adjust the format (e.g. papers, presentations, interviews, or project-based work) depending on people’s preferences. 

  

These are my thoughts — I hope some of this is helpful. Good luck with it and let me know how it goes!!

#### Scope
- Covering more recent developments – already have courses about foundational/introductory papers
- *How do we get topic and paper ideas?*
	- Asking for suggestions from participants – *possibly not enough engagement? Or too narrow scope due to limited available research experiences?*
#### Structure
- People have varying levels of familiarity with basic ideas in cogsci, how do we make this as accessible to as many people as possible?
	- Start with a review of key terms and concepts for understanding the paper
