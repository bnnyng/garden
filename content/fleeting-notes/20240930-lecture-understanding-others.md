# Notes

- Cognitive vs. emotional persepctive-taking

#### A tale of three regions
- Temporal (not specific)
- MPFC – less directly implicated, but creating “social events”/decoupling from “real events”
- rTPJ – deficits after damage
- Theory of mind tasks
- STS

#### Empathy

- Shared representations of physical and social pain?

#### Empathy beyond simulation
- Often empathy studies are gender segregated

#### Social exclusion

- __ (cyber-ball) paradigm?
- Cognitive vs. emotion

#### Mitchell reading

- Ventral vs. dorsal response to similarity vs. dissimilarity with others

#### Exam
- In short answer questions, clearly know about key findings of studies
