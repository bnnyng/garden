# Overview

>[!example] Essay prompt
>Economic growth is generally seen as a necessary ingredient for development. What challenges and opportunities did states in the developing world face in pursuing economic growth during the second half of the 20th century? How can we account for variation in whether they achieved growth and development?

# Rubric

> Answer one of the following three essay prompts. Your essay should engage in a detailed manner with materials from both the relevant class lectures and assigned readings from across **at least three different course modules.** Be sure to **define the core concepts** that you use, explain the **existing theories/hypotheses** that you discuss in your essay, and include empirical evidence to substantiate your argument. Anchor your essay in the majority of the lectures and readings from the module that you understand as the most relevant to the specific prompt that you select, and use some of the lectures and readings from the other modules to do things like define additional concepts, incorporate other relevant theories, and introduce more empirical evidence.

# Sketch

How countries go from poor to rich is one of the most consequential topics in economics and political science research, yet one of the most challenging to describe with any unified theory. While economic growth is distinct from human development in terms of state output—the former involves income, GDP, and levels of industrialization, while the latter is measured by life expectancy, education, and standard of living—the two categories are well understood to be mutually reinforcing (Module 4, Class 13, Slide 9). Thus, the term "development" is often used ... however, strong economic performance does not automatically lead to improved human conditions, I will take care to point out when the distinction matters. Along with good performance in development statistics, developed countries are associated with high state capacity and peaceful resolution of conflicts (Besley). This is particularly salient for countries in the "developing world" (a term which refers not to a process, but merely a descriptor of current status) in the middle of the 20th century, as many states were going through regime upheaval, whether a transition in regime type (i.e., "third wave of democracy") or decolonization. 

First, some conceptual clarity on the relationship between state, institutions, and development. In contrast to the characteristic state effectiveness of developed countries, countries in the “developing world” are characterized by lack of rule of law and insufficient state effectiveness for practical economic policymaking, such as the ability to tax, reinforce contracts, and organize government spending (Besley and Persson 2011, 1). Define state capacity so I can incorporate the first module. According to Besley and Presson's model, "good things go together." This model uses game theoretic logic, but little empirical evidence. Nonetheless, the value of focusing on quality of institutions is clear; the difficulty is that institutions are far too variable and have legacies.

Beyond rule of law (perhaps it *does* make sense to put this paragraph here?), we haven't yet said anything about the political economy of development, i.e., how the government interacts with the economic market. Market failures in the otherwise unregulated free market. Why the government intervenes to address market failures. So, an institution needs to have good rule of law, it needs to make the right choices, and it needs to be able to implement them.

Another dimension of quality of institution from the political point of view is the type of regime, authoritarian or democratic. Assumptions about the "third wave," buildup of regime transition literature. However, as Carouthers critiques, these depend on a minimal definition of democracy. Fully milk the transition to democracy topic. Likewise, the theories about democracy being better or worse make an assumption about minimal. Because, via Carbone, even when a regime does fit the definition of a democracy, free and fair elections do not guarantee outcomes. Problem with democracy, in theory, comes at the implementation stage. The converse also makes assumptions about state capacity and the capacity of the state. Gerring's case-study approach identifies the mechanism for success has something to do with how long the democracy has been around. There is not enough empirical evidence for either. The problem is that most regimes fall into the "gray zone," particularly in the time period we are concerned with, and to ignore those regimes for the sake of making this argument is missing a lot of evidence (i.e., China, arguably the most successful at developing at the time, as Tsai puts it. I also embrace this spirit!). Even if they do actually fit the definition of one or the other, there is no substantive evidence that regime type determines development, as success of either depends on a number of assumptions (pro auth assumes auth government has economic development as an actual interest, which seems almost trivially easy to argue against; pro democracy assumes a base level of state capacity, which brings us back to the Besley thing). More bemusement, more befuddlement, not much conceptual clarity to be found, etc.

Importance of the double movement. Acemoglu, etc. say that beyond quality of institution, people need an incentive to be innovative. This goes back to the classic theory of the predatory state: in resource extraction, state must make concessions.  Both the state and subjects have bargaining power, and we are particularly interested in the economic bargaining power of people. Also, when implementing economic policies, someone always loses? Acemoglu, etc. say is not so much about the nature of the institution itself but the nature of the relationship between state and people: extractive vs. inclusive institutions. Without incentive to innovate, no long-term growth or creative destruction. So the key determinant of the relationship is, along the path dependence argument, history of the institution itself, as they go on to say. This is why they make the argument for colonization being the determinant of development.

Okay, so which colonies were decolonizing? Some of the examples from Gerring, which were successful. And also set up to be democracies. The Congo was a big one. Extractive institutions *are* capable of some short-term growth, but not in long term. Cite some critiques from the lecture slides. The British vs. French rule of Cameroon is a particularly interesting comparative example: same initial conditions but differing outcomes. Hypothesis: more government legitimacy by the local rulers. So maybe there is something to the relationship idea? People have an incentive to innovate? Some form of inclusion?

Ugh I have such bad brain fog. Thanks, meds and caffeine. What was I saying?

So we have examined some of the theories at hand, as well as some cases from the middle of the 20th century, and the types of challenges they faced. Let's consolidate: the successes were those various democracies with the histories, relative success of Cameroon under British rule. The less developed were Congo, Cameroon under French rule. 

(How do I transition to this paragraph?) For developing countries in the mid 20th century, growth was synonymous with industrialization. Problems in the world economy faced. Export of raw goods was unfavorable. Here we compare Latin America and East Asia, both of which turned to protectionism (name the shared attributes, then point out the differences).

Latin America used ISI. Had low state autonomy, high backlash in the double movement. East Asian countries had high autonomy, invested in human development so there was less backlash, workforce was healthy lol. Able to pivot to different economic policy, make smarter manufacturing decisions. When ISI faltered, East Asia was able to sustain success by shifting strategy.

China is apparently a model for weak institutions coevolving with the economy. I disagree that the institutions were weak - revisit the two dimensions of a weak state. There was still high level of one or the other, organization maybe? Would I go as far as to say high state capacity? In particular, had state autonomy from rentiers (displacement of landlords), monopoly on violence (obviously), informal institutions? Either way, elite developmental coalition was able to form. 

In conclusion, East Asian countries were able to move rapidly into high income, and saw marked benefits in human development, which is ostensibly what we care about! Able to form elite coalitions and minimize backlash. Important to try to replicate as development in the world slows down today.
