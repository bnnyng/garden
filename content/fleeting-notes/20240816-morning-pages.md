The last virtue discussed in the Ben Franklin group I’ve been attending is chastity.

>[!quote]
>CHASTITY. Rarely use venery but for health or offspring, never to dulness, weakness, or the injury of your own or another’s peace or reputation.

What struck me most in this definition was how apparently lax it was. What is using venery for health? I feel like a similar sentiment was expressed by [[1890-schopenhauer-on-authorship-and-style]] on writing, the common thread being that one, in their own pursuits, should not inconvenience or harm another. To Schopenhauer, bad writing was indeed an inconvenience or burden to the readers.

Eliza McLamb’s Substack essay “[Everyone’s Writing Sounds the Same Now](https://www.wordsfromeliza.com/p/everyones-writing-sounds-the-same)” brought this to mind once again; it is essentially an ode to the “girl-blog industrial complex.” And I agree, everything you create will have the touch of another artist. But what of this focus on the creator, and not the audience? 

I spent a few hours editing a vlog today. To what end?

Maybe I’m bitter because I do want to write, be a writer, but I struggle to string words together. Maybe I’m more meant for a wordless medium. My brain feels stuffed with cotton clouds.

The past few nights I’ve had bouts of insomnia that are giving me traumatic flashbacks to my college days. I don’t know how to handle myself in those circumstances still—I feel like I lose all autonomy and sense of myself as a person.

I very rarely feel altogether “here.” I don’t even do any extreme substances, but maybe because I have been moderate for so long, any amount of anything is extremely destabilizing. First thing that comes to mind is that my ADHD medication causes me to dissociate, such as right now as I type these words. These words that aren’t good and don’t really make any sense.

Last night I took a CBD/CBN oil that definitely altered my cognition. It didn’t help me avoid what I was trying to avoid—purging, which still is the most effective antidote to that sleeplessness. The first night I was awake, I was more afraid of the eating disorder than the insomnia; the second night, it was the opposite. I would hate to perpetually make this trade-off. I wish I could just be normal.

In any case, insomnia and sleep deprivation is also cognition altering. The world feels very strange. Wasn’t there a study that it was as impairing as drunkenness? Perhaps like any other drug, it allows you to see the world in a new way. Many people have insomnia and lead uninteresting lives, but also a substantial amount of authors, geniuses, singular personalities have it. You do need the space to exist outside of functional society (e.g., having a job or family, for the most part, though perhaps men can get away with having their cake and eating it too more often). But perhaps their singularity is some rare cognitive ability to leverage the perspective of insomnia with lesser impairment of function. Joan Didion, Borges, who else?

I laid in bed and had a thought about something last night, but I can’t remember it. Hours and hours in the same place…I’m starting to be filled with fear at the sight of my own bed, or at least resignation. I feel as though I’ve sunk into the mattress, stagnant, paralyzed over whether to go or stay. What if going doesn’t work? It’s so much effort, I might as well lie here a bit longer. And so the evening goes.

I feel like I have cotton balls in my head this morning. I don’t know whether it’s the sleep deprivation hangover or the CBD.

It is impossible to come into contact with the world, with the other, while having insomnia. It gives you a too-heightened awareness of your own self and limitations, in additional to all the practical reasons.

Related, Simone Weil was afflicted by headaches. She had the unique ability to translate that into a cosmological, spiritual dedication? What is the word I am looking for? Conviction? Why does Weil draw me in? Perhaps, as opposed to all the other famous figures who demonstrate the potential association of insomnia with greatness by example, she is the one who gives a coherent cosmology of my suffering. I like to think that things have meaning outside their own existence. Back to existentialism, which I should probably linger on less because I don’t even comprehend all of Sartre’s [[1946-sartre-existentialism-is-a-humanism]], and I hear it is outmoded anyway; Sartre didn’t even agree with his own lecture at later stages of his life.

I have collected too many books in my Reader app and it’s making me anxious as well. Why? Maybe I have insomnia because the world is too large for me. Or I perceive things too fine grained to take in so much else, like a life-size map. We need some kind of [[Memory consolidation]] or else we go insane, we become catatonic, passive, unable to act because we are always catching up to the present; re: Funes the Memorious. It seems that my insomniac nights both protect me from engaging with the world, taking that risk, and permit me more time to wander. Back to voyeurism. 

And it’s the same with the eating disorder. When insomnia becomes too difficult, I have a back-up plan to not be a part of this world. I don’t know if it is truly a fear; more like inertia, habit that translates to apparent laziness and resistance to change. To put myself in the world is a lot of *work* for someone who overthinks. Is it possible to overthink but not in an anxious manner? I have always needed some help—at just 18, my brush with becoming an alcoholic. 

And as much as I try to shut out the world, I am simultaneously trying to maximize my experience within the constraints of my own design. I am both the cage and the bird breaking free.

It feels unnatural to not suffer. It feels unnatural to feel natural. As I was saying earlier, I can’t recall the last time I have felt altogether here as a person, as in not on any other substance. I can’t extract what each of the things I am doing to myself are doing to me as a person, doing to my mind, which is a point of fixation because I love to think about my own mind. Insomnia is one of them—how much more could I have been if I didn’t have this to “limit” me? (And am I in denial of some of the things I am doing to enable myself? Sure. It was stimulants, then in the past few days, undereating. It is so difficult to be a regular person when you have been drawn by impulses and are accustomed to highs and lows, excess. I don’t know why this makes me special compared to everyone else addicted to social media, for example. Is this a problem or just a mode of life?) 

Anyways, I won’t feel familiar to myself in my own brain for a while, because I’m also taking Wellbutrin indefinitely. I just feel like shit all the time, I can’t tell what the cause is. Speaking of which, am I still feeling retarded from restriction? I’m not even losing weight, I think. I’ve gotten used to it so I can’t tell. Another part where I am in denial.

How did I manage to sleep so little in Spring 2023? The longer I was up, the less I was able to come back down—more inertia, physical and psychosomatic (I was certainly buoyed by stimulants). But again, I have a very vanilla experience with psychic alterations. I have been curious just so I can feel some other way to be in the world, but now I am too lazy to seek it out.

I was sleeping great when I was feeling the most depressed this past month, and in the worst days of my eating disorder. Why do I exchange one suffering for another? And the draw of Weil is that my suffering is given meaning…

I never want to remember my own history. And I’m not fully able to, as if I weren’t me but only a partial observer.

After listening to most of [Daisy Alioto’s interview](https://longform.org/posts/longform-podcast-562-daisy-alioto) on the Longform podcast, I am feeling inspired to take up a writing practice. Not in any sort of serious capacity, I suppose, but more in the sense that I feel like I want to write, say things, be heard. I fail to articulate so much of what happens in my head. Well, maybe it’s not a failure per se, because by what or whose metric am I failing? 

Writing has always felt forced and thus, most of my memories of it are miserable. I only write when forced. But in this interview, Alioto describes how she reads every single pitch (“spec”?) sent to her; the author of some of the most popular articles in Dirt last year was discovered this way, a never-before-published mother in Georgia. Hearing this gives me hope that I could have something to say, which is rather exceptional in an age where everyone feels that way. I admire Alioto’s sensibilities quite a lot (“too business-minded for the literary world, too literary for the business world”), particularly the strategy of never *reacting* to what’s current. It makes me feel better about not having the sharpest take on current events, of really not knowing what’s going on, in general.

What can I say? What do I know the most about? My eating disorder, though I need more distance from this to talk about it. Emptiness. Quiet of not being online, versus being alone. An obsession with my own intellect and cognition. Of taking substances, trying to feel always sharper. About insomniac nights and wandering, both across the internet and physically. Of seeing the corners of campus where no one else has spotted. I could also submit such discussion to Columbia Spectator’s The Eye. 

I fall into the trap of comparison so easily. I don’t want to look at what other Columbia students are putting out, in general, but I always do. Reaction is not inspiration.

Maybe I could write about intellectual phases. First Weil, now sort of modernism, existentialism. Reading, once I have made it a more consistent practice in my life, and what it does for me. Feeling like writing because of reading. Having trouble enjoying any hobbies (and this is so trite, because everyone is depressed these days). To do this first though, I have to do more than dabble in ideas. I need sources, some meat.

That was what I had to scribble down while listening to the podcast. In my little notebook that I carry around with me in lieu of a notes app because of my Light Phone, although that is more or less a farce now. (An aside: I have put out so many words and I’m happy because I just love my fingers hitting the keys, watching the paragraphs grow. I want to make myself better, day by day. I like Alioto’s perspective on writer’s block, even if I think her analogy to a chef’s career does not make much sense. The business-minded, pragmatic nature speaks to me. I will overcome not by genius, but by sheer relentlessly positive action. Relentless positivity is a notion that will stick with me for a while.) 

The theme that has been cropping up recently in my life is intellectual voyeurism. I don’t know why this analogy is favored over something like a tasting menu; less pleasant, maybe, more reflective of my negative emotions about this tendency. I don’t know how to deeply be. Maybe I am afraid of deeply being, of locking myself into something and finding that I’m inadequate. More about the potential than the action. That is what existentialism makes painfully obvious about my failures. According to that, I am not a person. But according to something like modernist literature, I can just be a consciousness.

I act as a character in a modernist novel. I let myself be a conscious cloud, without any coherent form. The problem is, I am not a work of fiction, but meant to be a person. And thus, modernism reflects the fragmented identity of our times. This is all old news, I guess. But maybe it’s something that’s relevant, because I feel it so deeply. [[2013-eagleton-how-to-read-literature|How to Read Literature]] feels like it is describing me sometimes. 

It’s funny how I keep moving these pages around because I can’t decide where to put them. As in, around in my vault. Thus I fritter away my life. Anyways, running note it is.

Intellectual voyeurism sparked in my head as an idea when I saw a Reddit post about studying math. It’s precisely how I feel about learning math. One other problematic thing is that I’ve made learning math into an identity that it is not; I am trying to force essence without existence. I have a poor track record of being the kind of person I say I am, in general. Relate quite a lot to Clarissa Dalloway, I guess. Math in particular is very conducive to this feeling because as an undergraduate, you barely scrape the surface of content, so maybe it makes sense that I would focus more on the doing than the knowing. Like Simone Weil’s LARPing. 

I feel anxious to say and read everything at once. I’m paralyzed. I do very little.

Math is an intellectual world in which I never really belong. I treat it with respect like I’m visiting a foreign land. I am passive, not active. And I’m not sure if it is too painful for me to learn. I like to watch rather than do, or maybe I’ve gotten into a habit of watching rather than doing. I want to document, record, work and type letters into a text file. 

And how do you become a part of anything if you don’t have a hand to guide you? For solitary activities like reading literature, you just have to jump in and do it yourself, start somewhere. Feel incredibly confused, and without the persistence of a person deeply invested in the task, the wandering eye gets bored and tired and frustrated. It flits from item to item. Maybe I just want to feel like a part of something. I don’t know why I’m so afraid to jump in.

All I can talk about now is iterant wandering. All I have done in the past is wandering. I can’t explain anything. Why did I drink away my freshman year? Why do I feel addicted to a behavior now? How did I let my world get so small? What should I do next? Why do I think and worry so much?

Intellectual voyeurism. There is something there.
