## Statement of interest

>In 300 words or less, please explain your interest in applying for the SURFiN Program, including how participating in this program will help you achieve your academic and career goals.

By participating in SURFiN, I hope to make tangible progress in pursuing a research career and receive targeted training I lacked in past experiences. Although I would benefit from any SURFiN lab, I am especially eager to work on Lucas Tian’s project because it lies at the intersection of my primary interests (and majors): mathematics and cognitive science. 

In the short term, lab work will teach me practical computational techniques, and possibly a conceptual foundation, for my senior thesis in the 2025-2026 school year. Further ahead, the emphasis on interdisciplinary collaboration with researchers in theoretical neuroscience and cognition will give me valuable familiarity with groups and projects I could connect with in graduate school. 

- Mention interest in Josh Tenenbaum’s work? The reason I became 

As a first-generation, low-income student, I 

- Why lab?
	- Intersection between cognitive science and computational rigor, neuroscience and study of intelligence
- Short-term goals
	- Develop skills and make connections to do a senior thesis project for my degree
	- Get a better understanding of the field itself
	- Become familiar with what groups are doing what research so that I have a direction of where I want to apply for grad school
- Long-term goals
- Diversity focus
	- First-gen college student, have always felt behind in terms of understanding *what* careers are available, still figuring out how a research career even works. Lack of connections to any industry or academia
	- Allow me to progress on my immediate career goals without worrying about funding, employment that is directly related to my future
## Research experience summary

>In 300 words or less, please include a brief description of your prior and/or planned experience in the following subject areas: neuroscience, psychology, biology, computer science, math, physics or other relevant subjects. Experience may include research, project(s) or subject area study. Applicants are not expected to have research experience. In the absence of research experience, please detail any relevant coursework. This is intended to help us better understand each applicant's transcript and assess their fit with the available lab opportunities.

- Academic experience
	- Double major in cognitive science and pure mathematics, computational study of intelligence
	- Survey course of strategies used across cognitive science, including behavioral and “hard” neuroscience
		- Familiar with cognitive science theoretical frameworks and history like the different levels of analysis, computationalism vs. connectionism
	- In terms of computational neuroscience, have been in journal club at the more cutting-edge research, have experience/comfort with reading literature
	- Planned – the Neural Code computational neuroscience course
- Project experience
	- Mathematical modeling, including probabilistic programming
	- Data-driven modeling (describe problem)
- Research experience
	- Computational neuroscience with Grace Lindsay – custom DNNs as well as large models, neuron-by-neuron analysis
	- Planned – Santa Fe Institute
## Additional information

>In 100 words or less, please include additional information or circumstances not reflected elsewhere in your application. This may include an explanation of factors that may have affected your past academic or extracurricular performance, such as family care responsibilities, illness, military service or other factors. Please note that all application materials will be reviewed by Simons Foundation staff, external reviewers, and mentors/labs that you are invited to interview with if selected as a finalist for this program.

- Working gap year to fund my undergraduate education
	- However, have tried to stay engaged with academic/research community as much as possible: auditing classes, participating in math modeling competition, computational neuroscience journal club

>**Project Title:** Neural mechanisms of compositional planning in a macaque drawing task
>
>**Project Description:** How can networks of neurons create intelligence? This is the central question of cognitive science. A key to answering this question is understanding compositionality or the fundamental ability for the brain to generate complex thoughts and actions by systematically recombining simpler components (e.g., like in language). We aim to uncover the neural basis of compositionality with a novel approach combining a new macaque drawing task, large-scale neural recordings and computational modeling. In this SURFiN project, we will explore the relationship between neural activity and action planning. The SURFiN fellow will analyze neural and behavioral data collected from macaques making a variety of drawings. The fellow will build computational models to decode cognitive drawing plans directly from neural activity. The fellow can expect to gain experience analyzing neural activity and macaque behavior and in building a variety of computational models, from linear classifiers to neural nets. Moreover, because this is an interdisciplinary project collaborating with Xiao-Jing Wang (theoretical neuroscientist at NYU) and Josh Tenenbaum (cognitive scientist at MIT), there will be opportunities to gain experience across neuroscience and artificial intelligence. The findings may have broad implications, including for brain-machine interfaces, and in understanding how cognition works in the brain.

>**Mentor Biography:** Lucas Tian is a postdoctoral fellow in the Laboratory of Neural Systems at The Rockefeller University. He received a bachelor’s in biology from the University of Chicago in 2011, and a doctorate in neuroscience from the University of California, San Francisco in 2019 studying neural mechanisms of vocal learning in songbirds (advised by Michael Brainard). He then decided to focus his research on neural and computational mechanisms of primate cognition, and to do so he first completed a visiting postdoctoral fellowship in computational cognitive science with Josh Tenenbaum at MIT in 2019. He moved to Rockefeller in late 2019, where he is currently advised by Winrich Freiwald and co-advised by Xiao-Jing Wang (NYU) and Josh Tenenbaum (MIT). His research focuses on the neural mechanisms of high-level cognition and intelligence in primates. His approach is to study behavior of non-human primates in complex cognitive tasks, combined with large-scale neural recordings and computational modeling. His ongoing work focuses on mechanisms of compositional action planning in a novel drawing task. During his postdoctoral research, he has been awarded the NIH Ruth L. Kirschstein NRSA F32 Fellowship and the NINDS K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award.
