# Lecture Notes: Neuroscience III

- **Neuron doctrine** = neurons are the *functional* units of the brain, distinct from physical units (cells, obviously); functionality is causal closure, emergent re: [[@2024rosas]]
	- Neurons/transistors have all-or-nothing behavior; exploiting feedback processes that make energy flow in and out, reach threshold
	- [[Neuroscience qua biology vs. neuroscience qua psychology]]
	- **What kind of knowledge does neuroscience give you?**
- Atom-to-atom connections canâ€™t predict behavior; but can neurons?
	- Atom-to-atom connections can predict neural behavior?
	- Explanation and prediction are currently only feasible at the same level of granularity as the thing being explained
- Bottom-up vs. top-down: *which is more effective?*
