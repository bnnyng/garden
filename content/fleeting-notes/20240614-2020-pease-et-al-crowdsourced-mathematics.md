# Summary

This paper is a survey of different uses of online collaborative mathematical activity, or **crowdsourced mathematics**. In contrast with traditional mathematics research practices, crowdsourced data can capture the *knowledge generation process* and effectively takes place *in situ*. 

---
# Key terms

- **Unstructured crowd** = a crowd were participants are treated as interchangeable.
- **Structured crowd** = a crowd that shows clear divisions of labor and authority.

# Notes

## Why crowdsourcing?

- Crowdsourcing addresses limitations of traditional mathematics *practice* research: we can access the *knowledge generation process* and can be observed *in situ*.

## Crowdsourced data

- **Question-and-answer sites** – sources of *known* answers to mathematics problems which leverages crowd expertise (participation by professional mathematicians) and collective evaluation (upvoting best solutions)
	- Examples: Math Overflow, Stack Exchange
- **Collaborative problem-solving** – open online participation to solve high-level mathematics problems, which leverages diverse expertise to make conceptual leaps as well as “organizing, explaining, and reinterpreting known ideas.”
	- Example: Polymath project
- Question-and-answer sites are less than collaborative problem-solving.
