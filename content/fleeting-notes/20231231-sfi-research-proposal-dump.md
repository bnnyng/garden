	- Analogy making with sensory data (or infant data)
		- Related to above: generalization capabilities to distinguish between nouns and verbs
- Active inference
	- Performing with GFlowNets
- Conceptual abstraction, analogy-making, and visual recognition in AI
	- Theory of mind with GFlowNet architecture?
	- Common sense/core knowledge
	- Intuitive math, intuitive physics, learning simple proofs in mathematics
- Social learning and social dynamics (like Jaques et al)
	- What kind of behavior emerges?
- Modeling something like psychedelics
- Evolutionary learning of causal relationships and generalization
- Other forms of consciousness and definitions of consciousness
	- Emergent consciousness
- Attention mechanism and global workspace theory
