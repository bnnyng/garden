- Project 1: Evolving a core knowledge system
	- Background
		- Spelke’s theories of core knowledge: [[2019-spelke-from-core-concepts-to-new-systems-of-knowledge]]
		- Chose one to evolve? Try to see what kind of core knowledge gets evolved, whether it ends up being useful for anything? Give similar tasks as used in developmental psychology in each of these (pre-defined) domains, hope that something has a result?
	- Importance
		- [[Evolution is the only guaranteed method of producing general intelligence]]
	- GENERAL approach
		- Evolutionary algorithm
		- Give different tasks over time
		- Test by doing similar tasks to infants and animals
		- Example of evolving a system: number
- Project 2: The role of social influence as a “regulizer” for a multi-agent system
	- Background
		- Why social influence matters – 
		- Perspective? – multi agent network “as a single agent, influence could be used as a regularizer to encourage different modules of the network to integrate information from other networks”
			- [[2019-jaques-social-influence-as-intrinsic-motivation]]
			- Related to complexity, because there is no central controller!
			- Demonstrated emergent communication like bee “waggle” dance – insect colonies as prime examples of complex systems
		- OR modeling collective intelligence as a network of interacting components?
	- Importance

Effective communication between individuals in an organized group is crucial for collective adaptation. This can take pretty creative forms in nature; for example, honey bees perform a “waggle dance” to transmit spatial information about resources to other hive members. Jaques et al. (2019) saw similar behavior in a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) setting. The researchers implemented intrinsic social motivation—the kind that leads to indirectly rewarded social behaviors, like choosing collaboration in the classic prisoner’s dilemma—in a reinforcement learning framework, which typically uses extrinsic motivation, or explicit rewards, to improve agents’ performance on some task. Not only did agents with intrinsic social motivation perform much better on a social dilemma game, but also, unexpectedly, these agents started using their actions on the game map to signal the presence or absence of resources to other agents!
I would like to further investigate the relationship between social influence and emergent communication in MARL.

- Embodied learning types
	- Self-generated learning (e.g., by infants)
	- Training LLMs on language used with children
		- Spelke talk! “Ancient knowledge” and language systems, looking, surprise.
	- Analogy making with sensory data (or infant data)
		- Related to above: generalization capabilities to distinguish between nouns and verbs
- Active inference
	- Performing with GFlowNets
- Conceptual abstraction, analogy-making, and visual recognition in AI
	- Theory of mind with GFlowNet architecture?
	- Common sense/core knowledge
	- Intuitive math, intuitive physics, learning simple proofs in mathematics
- Social learning and social dynamics (like Jaques et al)
	- What kind of behavior emerges?
- Modeling something like psychedelics
- Evolutionary learning of causal relationships and generalization
- Other forms of consciousness and definitions of consciousness
	- Emergent consciousness
- Attention mechanism and global workspace theory
