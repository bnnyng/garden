# The reasoning-as-model-sharing story

- ==Key questions: How do people work together to solve a problem? How do mathematicians reason?==
- “Dialogical” definition of reasoning and sharing mental models/mental representations
	- [[2017-mercier-sperber-the-enigma-of-reason|Mercier and Sperber (2017)]] define **reason** as a form of inference, or producing new information from existing information, that specifically focuses on other people’s reasoning—explanations, justifications, argumentation
		- (Reasoning’s natural environment is interpersonal communications—works as intended since “best idea wins”)
	- Reasoning has two functions:
		- (1) ==In the process of justifying oneself and convincing others, the “reasoner” communicates motivations, lets others know what to expect and what is expected from them in turn==
		- (2) ==To make communication effective in the absence of trust!!==
	- (Along the lines of Simon’s UCR talk) Reality is mediated by a model that the mind interacts with; communication includes modeling other possible models, model sharing
		- Relationship to (1) and (2): communicating reasoning involves sharing “sense-making” model and establishing “normative” model?
	- ==Takeaway: what people are doing in Polymath is indeed reasoning together (and this is how we understand the term “reasoning”); such reasoning involves sharing mental representations (to motivate some of our cognitive categories later)==
		- That is, we are justified in answering our key questions with this data/approach
		- [[2020-dutilh-novaes-dialogical-roots-of-deduction|Dutilh Novaes (2020)]] has more pedantic justification for “mathematical presentations” as appropriate ontological entities for analyzing dialogical reasoning—mainly, such presentations are constructed with a level of granularity/”acceptable gaps” for the given audience
- The semantic story – tracing what it looks like for reasoning to “work” and have “best idea win”
	- Diversity 
		- (Clarifying the use of “diversity”: more about diversity of topics/representations; to the extent that we measure diversity in individuals, we are talking about functional diversity—differences in representations—rather than identity diversity.)
		- Analyzing results: If we see an increase in the coarse/fine diversity differential at the end, would match shift in audience from other mathematicians already familiar with the problem to paper reviewers re: [[2020-dutilh-novaes-dialogical-roots-of-deduction|Dutilh Novaes (2020)]] 
	- Novelty/transience – TBD?
- The cognitive story – TBD
	- Describe some of the topics we expect to see based on literature
		- Most are already closely associated with reasoning-as-model-sharing (expectations, explanations/justifications, planning, etc., could all be connected with this idea; also explains the overlap/difficulty of extracting distinct topics)!
- Conclusion…
