# Lecture: Responses to Single Stimuli

- Kinesis = entirely random
- Taxis = directional motion (e.g., across a gradient) when there is evidently a preferential direction to move
	- Typically toward good conditions
	- Main difference from kinesis is that there’s a direction
- Modal (fixed) action patterns = stereotyped set of movements in response to a particular stimulus
	- Biologically relevant
	- What is necessary? – stimulus itself must be very specific
	- Once they begin, not responsive to changes in stimuli!
	- E.g., goose retrieving egg that has rolled out of the nest; if egg is removed in the middle, the goose continues the action
- Reflex = also a single behavioral response to a single stimulus
	- Happen almost entirely peripherally – brain doesn’t have to do anything!
	- Sensory neuron → interneuron → motor neuron
	- Example: pulling hand away from stove
- All things before are in some sense fixed, can’t be learned
- Spinal cord model – can reflexes be modified? (behavioral outputs)
- Habituation = attenuation of response to a stimulus; behavioral response to a stimulus decreases over time
	- Habituation is very specific to the single stimulus
	- Spaced trials are remembered better – further spacing = better retention
- Sensitization = a response to a single stimulus so that the organism’s responses to a WIDE ARRAY of stimuli are now heightened
	- State of high arousal – constant state that only changes with the bro
	- PTSD? Taste aversion? Context-dependent

# Review

- Which responses to single stimuli are **unconditioned**? Give an example of each.
- How many stimuli does
