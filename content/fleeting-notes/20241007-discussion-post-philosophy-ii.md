# Sketch

[[@2011chalmers]]

- Systems have same causal topology $\implies$ substitution with a different physical material mapped to the same formal part of the computation would lead to no change in processing. This is an argument that phenomenal properties are organizational invariants

[[@1995egan]]

- Mischaracterization of Marr‚Äôs levels ‚Äì articulated the computational cognitive science agenda
- ‚ÄúSemantic interpretations play a role in computational psychology analogous to the role played by explanatory models in the physical sciences.‚Äù
	- An ‚Äúexplanatory‚Äù model is an equation?
- **Cognitive function** = ‚Äúa function whose arguments and values are epistemically related, such that the outputs of the computation can be seen as rational or cogent given the inputs.‚Äù
- How are ‚Äúbroad‚Äù and ‚Äúnarrow‚Äù content oppositions?
- Interesting that they are so pessimistic about computational accounts of certain mental states, yet they are generally thought of as a part of computation. Then how can we account for them?
	- Context-dependent ‚Äì issue is that believing is about things and abstracting away from the things makes your theory not very explanatory. How do you stay committed to computationalism then?

# Discussion post

[[@1995egan]] attempts to connect a formal, computational theory of cognitive processes with the explanatory usefulness of mental representations. Specifically, while the most essential characterizations of information processing are strictly mathematical and environment-independent, the representations involved must be interpreted in order actually explain the cognitive phenomena/behaviors we care about explaining. Both Egan and [[@2011chalmers]] emphasize the role of isomorphism between abstract formalisms and the causal organization of a system (Chalmers calls this ‚Äúimplementation‚Äù and Egan ‚Äúinterpretation,‚Äù which is an interesting distinction in intentionality/design). 

Chalmers addresses the ‚Äúdiscreteness/continuity‚Äù complaint from my last post (nothing new under the sun‚Ä¶). He states that continuous organization does not pose a challenge to computational sufficiency/explanation because ‚Äúa discrete simulation can replicate everything essential to cognitive functioning ‚Ä¶ even though it may not duplicate every last detail of a given episode of cognition.‚Äù I feel like this affordance needs more justification, especially given the emphasis on ‚Äútopological invariants‚Äù (i.e., properties that are preserved by continuous deformations). In mathematics, the discrete topology is very special; it is finer than any other topology. If these borrowed mathematical definitions are taken seriously, then Chalmers‚Äô claim is far from trivial. Otherwise, it seems inappropriate to use definitions from a discipline dependent on deductive precision in an imprecise manner.

On a related note, Egan echoes Fodor‚Äôs ‚Äúconsiderable pessimism about the properties of characterizing in formal, computational terms more central cognitive processes such as belief fixation.‚Äù I am again confused why both authors are committed to computational theories that have major gaps in explaining what we might otherwise call cognition. I am skeptical about the possibility of a single abstraction for belief fixation, since what a belief is depends entirely on environment. It seems plausible to me, though, that different beliefs (or mechanisms of belief fixation) may fall into essentially different computational categories, just as we are now able to distinguish between different types of belief using environmental context. (Actually, this had better be plausible to me, since I am involved in research that models human function learning/teaching using Gaussian processes, and am interested in computational cognitive science more broadly.)
