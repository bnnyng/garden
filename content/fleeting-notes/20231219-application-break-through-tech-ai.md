- Advice about explaining gap year:
	- I think you can share more detailed/specific information in one of your essay responses. On your resume, you don‚Äôt need to change any of the information in your education section other than updating your expected graduation month/year. When describing your current position, you could frame it as ‚Äúa working gap year to support completing my undergraduate degree‚Äù
	- Sometimes the best course of action with resume gaps is to be honest! I think its fine to indicate that you are taking a gap year from school for personal financial reasons and to share that you are working during this time.

I am interested in an AI career that steers impressive technical developments in a more human direction. 

Despite potential for AI to benefit humanity at world-system (e.g., helping climate change efforts), societal (automation that enables people to do more meaningful work), and individual levels (personalized healthcare), many of these possibilities assume more social protections than we really have. For example, since we don‚Äôt have universal basic income, workers who have ‚Äúmenial‚Äù tasks automated away will actually be worse off due to unemployment. The tension between AI innovation and better living standards is also seen in the Hollywood strike, where demands included banning AI in the writer‚Äôs room.

AI represents a paradigm shift in technology‚Äôs role in our lives. I am excited by AI as a tool for progress, but that isn‚Äôt guaranteed unless we consider how its benefits can be distributed beyond private companies and shareholders. 

- I want to change the industry‚Äôs perspective, raise questions like‚Ä¶
- Much of my volunteer work has been with HEP

- Practically, I have a great deal of interest in using the tools of ML and data science
