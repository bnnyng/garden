# Notes
## Objectives

- Tactics for juniors
- Promote healthier sense of stakes
	- What is actually important?
	- What might be overstated in importance?

## Reflection

- What have I learned since the spring of my first year?
	- No major
	- Classes that inspired my study
- What made me optimistic?
- Were my decisions more or less important than I expected?

## What is Beyond Barnard?

- Start connecting about graduate school fellowships!
- Walk in before meeting with staff, which can be hard to secure

## Take advantage as a junior

- “Focus” series introduces students to career fields, alumni, employers
- “Career Insights” for major-based programming
- Barnard Connect for virtual mentoring the basis of shared industries, roles, identities, etc.
- Fulbright toolkit – 2024 version launches in May; [fellowships database](https://barnard.edu/beyond-barnard/competitive-fellowships)

## Misconceptions

- All internships are gone by spring semester
	- Internships can be found via networking, *built*
- Consulting, finance, and technology are the main fields for return offers
	- Internships that prove what you don’t like are also useful
	- Leverage BBIP, show how I have all the tools to be useful and resources to work
- Urgency to pursue more education in graduate school
	- Graduate school will always be there
	- Try fellowships, working, traveling – might make you a better student

## Next steps

- Instead of focusing on career, think about what kind of skills and experiences to develop in the next 6-12 months
	- Exercise: think broadly about skills I currently have, identify gaps I might want to fill via internships
- Apply to fewer positions and talk to more people – trust yourself!
- In addition to academic work, take some consistent amount of time each week to take steps towards career exploration – become regimented!
- Solidify academic relationships
	- Find faculty who are interested in your professional development

## Reaching out to people

- [Barnard College LinkedIn home](https://www.linkedin.com/school/barnard-college/people/)
	- Filter by major study, organization
	- See distribution by industry positions
- To do: develop a list of 25 people to reach out to, work with a PCA or staff to conduct outreach to people
	- See [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/beyondbarnard) for specific workshops
- LinkedIn elements
	- Profile picture
	- Background image
	- About – academic work, work outside classroom, **what you’re looking for**, happy to connect with Barnard alumni, email
- Use faculty and office hours as practice for making meaningful relationships in the community
