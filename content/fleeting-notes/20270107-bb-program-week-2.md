# Review

> What were my biggest wins from last week?

- I made it through four shifts at work, which is the most I have worked in a week! I feel like I got to know my coworkers much better—our interactions are more familiar, more jokes. This is great because I feel like I’m super awkward around them, being a different age.
- I got out of my comfort zone in terms of going out and socializing: I went to dinner with some semi-strangers, and also introduced myself to some people at UW. Although I won’t keep going to classes, it was a nice reminder of how I flourish around others.
- I found a good goal to work on for the next month: the mathematical modeling workshop. I am excited to learn a lot from this.
- I managed one night after coming home from work without relapsing, which I don’t think I have done before because the habit of driving to the store after work is so ingrained.

> What were the 2-3 biggest challenges I experienced?

- I struggled to pause whenever I had a binge urge, particularly after a long shift at work when I am both craving comfort and drained enough to take actions automatically. Leaving my actions uncertain was always an excuse to binge.
- I struggled to stay on track with waking up early because I would stay up very late to binge. This made me feel rushed and unproductive in the mornings, and more likely to stay in the cycle.

> What helped me? What worked to create those successes?

- Pausing and thinking through my actions without trying to suppress thoughts or distract myself. I know that, rationally, I do not want to binge and purge. Distraction is a way for me to suppress that cognitive dissonance. The key to recovering will be to actually listen.
- Waking up early in the morning set the tone for my day and helped to keep me on track.
- Eating later at night helped me not go to bed hungry, which removed the physical need to binge. This was especially effective on that one night I came home from work and did not relapse.

> What am I going to *keep* doing?

- Waking up earlier in the morning
- Having my last meal later at night so that I do not go to bed hungry
- Being active throughout the day, so that I am physically tired and ready for bed
- Staying interested and engaged in different intellectual projects, keeping things fresh for myself

> What am I going to *stop* doing?

- Having any alcohol
- Leaving things “up in the air”—this is always an excuse to relapse by making it seem like I do not have control over the situation. Binging and purging is always my own choice

> What am I going to *start* doing?

- Implementing a pause before I drive home from work, as well as after getting home after work and before going into my house
- Be accountable to my team members in the modeling workshop

> What are my top three goals for next week? How will I measure them?

1. Use the pause method every time I get an urge, reminding myself that relapsing is a choice.
2. Spend a majority of evenings without relapsing.
3. Wake up at 9 a.m. at the latest each day.

- Monday – CUMMW Stage 1 due
- Wednesday – Appointment to sell books at Third Place Books

# Themed journal questions

- What is your binge and purge pattern? (includes cues, thoughts, emotions, and behaviors—the more detail the better)
- What are points you can pause during this pattern?
- How is eating consistently and eating enough helping you, and is there anything you need to adjust in your eating pattern?
- What thoughts and feelings encourage you to binge and purge?
- How do you want to intentionally think and act when urges come up, regardless of your initial reaction?
- If urges were a separate person, how would you speak to them?
