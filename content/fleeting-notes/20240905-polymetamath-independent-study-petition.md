>1. A student seeking an Independent Study must complete the attached form, providing the following information:
>	1. A brief but comprehensive description and rationale for the proposed project (250 words).
>	2. A detailed description of the final project (If an essay or paper, specify the number of pages required.).
>	3. A bibliography or list of readings/supplementary materials in proper citation format.
>2. To determine the appropriate number of credits, consider this guidance on course points: Each point of academic credit requires a minimum of three hours work each week in a 14-week semester, typically divided into one hour of classroom instruction (with an hour of classroom instruction defined as at least 50 minutes) and two hours of independent work (which may include readings, problem sets, papers, individual or group projects, and so forth). Students must specify the number and duration of their regular meetings with their independent study sponsor. The following guidelines may also be helpful:
>	1. A typical 1-credit independent study project will include a total of 8-10 pages of writing or its equivalent;  1-credit projects can run for the entire semester, but typically last only 6-8 weeks.
>	2. A typical 2-credit independent study project could last the entire semester, or could take 8-10 weeks of the semester, and include a total of 15-20 pages of writing or its equivalent.
>	3. A typical 3-credit independent study project should last the entire semester, and include a total of 20-25 pages of writing or its equivalent
>	4. Four credits are very rarely granted, and only in exceptional cases, with the approval of the department chair.
>3. Independent Studies must have a faculty sponsor, who, in addition to providing supervision, will review and grade the culminating project or paper. Any full-time Barnard faculty member may serve as a faculty sponsor. Adjunct and Visiting Professors are not eligible to serve. Columbia faculty sponsors for Independent Studies may be added via the appropriate Columbia University department, but are not eligible to be added through the Barnard CPAS process.
