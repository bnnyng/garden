> Why do you want to participate in our Break Through Tech AI program? What are your personal, academic, or professional goals for participating in this program? * (required, 250 word limit)

My main goal for participating in the program is to complement my existing skills and curiosity about AI technology with practical industry experience. 

First, the program is an invaluable opportunity for my circumstances: I am currently taking a working gap year to fund my undergraduate degree. Although I try to refine my skills via online coursework and personal projects, the apparent lack of professional development and resume “gap” present a net setback for my involvement in the AI industry—already limited for me as a first generation, low income student. 

In addition to fitting the context of my application, the program suits my interests in AI innovations. As a cognitive science major specializing in intelligent systems, I am perpetually engaging with AI research. Outside of coursework, I regularly update my domain knowledge by implementing papers for novel techniques (most recently, Bayesian NNs and GFlowNets). This hobby, along with my formal computational neuroscience research experience, has given me familiarity with fine-grained details of AI systems as well as the meta-benefit of quickly learning new AI concepts. I also discovered that I am more suited for the tangible engineering problems of industry than open-ended inquiry in academic research. 

For professional goals, I see the program’s mentorship and peer community as a rare bridge between academia and industry. AI Studio not only gives me experience with the full ML development pipeline, but also access to a wide variety of industry partners that allows me to explore my interdisciplinary interests.

My career interests can be divided into practical, intellectual, and ethical factors.

First, as the scope of my research experiences—molecular biology, applied linear algebra, and computational neuroscience—shows, I flourish when I can continuously learn from my work. Practically speaking, the innovative field of AI fits my working personality perfectly.

I am also excited by how an AI career aligns with my mathematics and cognitive science degrees. As I discovered through my linear optimization research, having strong quantitative skills is necessary for the most innovative algorithm development. Meanwhile, I can use cognitive science tools to interpret AI performance rationally, without being distracted by inflated theories about general intelligence. My cognitive science degree—which covers psychology, neuroscience, linguistics, philosophy, and computer science—also prepares me for the interdisciplinary mindset needed as AI is applied to more domains. I am particularly thrilled by the use of AI to advance human reasoning, such as mathematical proof assistants.

Finally, I am interested in steering impressive AI developments in a more human direction. Most theories about how AI benefits society depend on more social protections than we really have. For example, since we don’t have universal basic income, automating away “menial” tasks actually makes workers worse off because of unemployment. The tension between AI innovation and better living standards is also seen in the Hollywood strike, where demands included banning AI in the writer’s room. In my career, I hope to help distribute AI benefits beyond private corporations, coupling technical and human progress.

My time at Columbia University’s Spectator Publishing Company gave me valuable “behavioral” experience for the workplace. Even as a trainee, my perspective was valued by the most senior members. I learned to unabashedly ask questions, to disagree with both grace and firmness, and most importantly, how to account for my mistakes. Once I became an associate, responsible for coordinating all the other copy editors during our six-hour newsroom shifts, I learned to mentor my own trainees with the same openness and often benefited from their keen editorial observations or unanswerable questions. I hope these “soft” skills will help me develop strong personal and professional connections in the BTT community.

Further, as a research fellow at NYU’s Center for Data Science, I investigated how category selectivity in individual artificial neurons impacts classification in various deep learning architectures. I learned coding skills and DL theory that prepares me for both practical and conceptual aspects of the BTT program. More generally, I developed a fascination with manipulating neurons to achieve different predictions, and began to seriously consider where to do similar work in an AI career.

Most recently, I participated in a hackathon-like mathematical modeling contest, where teams were challenged to write a 25-page paper over four days. Despite working remotely due to my gap year, my team maintained constant, efficient communication during both the actual competition and month-long preparation. Based on this positive experience with remote collaboration, I look forward to being a successful AI Studio participant.

I am proud of my project of implementing a custom neural network layer as a part of my computational neuroscience research at NYU. In deep learning, a convolutional layer processes an input, usually an image, by scanning over it with a smaller “kernel” filter. Because the same filter is applied all over the image, convolutional layers are called “locally connected with shared weights.” Although computationally efficient, weight sharing may cause the network to miss more nuanced input features. Because my research was about how perturbing convolutional layers affects high-level “attention,” I was especially interested in how attention performed differently with *unshared* weights. 

To create my custom class, I began by creating a method for the unshared local convolution operation, which was inspired by the existing PyTorch convolution method. After encoding the mathematical formula, I defined the locally connected layer as a custom class, which I was able to add to my models like any other PyTorch layer. I learned to leverage GPU parallel processing to use the weights themselves without running out of memory, a major engineering challenge.

This project stands out to me because not only did I successfully translate mathematical theory to practical code, my work is evergreen: even though I no longer work with the lab, other members continue to use and improve my code for their own experiments. In the process, I discovered my preference for engineering tangible solutions over more theoretical work, which had a profound influence on my AI career goals.

My most demanding team experience was competing alongside two other students in the international Mathematical Contest in Modeling. The four-day competition involves submitting a 25-page solution to a realistic, data-driven modeling problem. The challenge lay in not only defining an accurate model and thoroughly explaining its implications, but also distinguishing ourselves from 20,000 other entries.

I’d never been on a team with our exact circumstances. We had very different backgrounds—my teammates both transferred from the Air Force this year. We were strangers, yet we connected over our diverse, complementary skills and were all highly invested in our shared goal—few voluntarily participate in a math competition!

To accomplish quality analysis and writing in the few competition dates, we needed a calculated schedule, precise time management skills, and efficient task distribution. Over January, we replicated, then improved, a previous winner’s paper to produce our own MCM-level report. This “dress rehearsal” not only gave us practice in essential modeling techniques, but allowed us to settle into distinct roles. One teammate, also a junior, focused on model conceptualization; the other, a freshman, was less mathematically mature and conducted simpler error analyses. Given my strengths in programming and scientific writing, I led decisions about our paper structure, made crucial final edits for clarity and consistency, and wrote our strategy’s actual code. Although we won’t know competition results for a few months, I am proud of our completion of the paper and the camaraderie we developed in the process.

>Break Through Tech AI aims to create a pathway for underrepresented women into the fields of AI, machine learning, and data science. Our program intentionally fosters a safe and inclusive community that welcomes female-identifying students as well as members of other underrepresented groups in these fields. Why do you want to learn in this environment and our community? * (required, 250 word limit)

I’ve always been conscious of gender’s effect on power dynamics in the classroom. I chose to attend Barnard, a women’s college, because of its unique culture of vulnerability and acceptance, which would seem like weakness outside of a community for marginalized genders. However, Barnard has only a handful of mathematics professors and undergraduates, so my classes are taken with mostly men in Columbia’s department. The stark contrast I’ve seen in attitudes towards one’s peers has made me eager to learn in the inclusive BTT community.

Specifically, many of my STEM peers are deeply impersonal in their career development. I hear many “horror stories” about receiving only a few interviews after sending out hundreds of applications to every technology and quantitative finance company imaginable. As a first generation student, I have fewer resources to meet those numbers: not only am I “catching up” in all aspects of professional and academic life, my actual time is limited by work-study. Previously, I despaired of ever landing a job in the competitive AI industry, and dreaded the coldness of any workplace that miraculously hired me from such a flood of applications.

Barnard’s close-knit community and distinctively strong alumni network give me hope in the value of connections. Alumni mentorship has given me otherwise inaccessible research positions; even on my gap year, I’ve been welcomed into a vibrant alumni book club. I look forward to forming close relationships in the BTT community, especially in an industry indifferent or outwardly hostile to many members.
