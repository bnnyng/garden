# Review

> What were my biggest wins from last week?

- Everything related to participating in [[20240104-CUMMW|CUMMW]] was an opportunity to grow for me! I got the chance to do collaborative work with my team members, I pushed myself to be more productive, and I gained some specific knowledge that will be useful for my career.
- In particular, I managed to push through a lot of binge urges because I needed to stay accountable to my team.
- I finally finished up the SFI research application that has been haunting me.

> What were the 2-3 biggest challenges I experienced?

- I struggled to stay motivated in building new habits for recovery. After working all day, I didn’t want to put more effort into the discomfort of changing my routines. In particular, I didn’t try to implement the pause after my shift at Stateside, when it is most automatic for me to stop by the store for binge food.
- I had a hard time taking care of my other needs in the pursuit of intellectual growth. I wasn’t very physically active, did not give consideration to my eating patterns, and did not do anything socially enriching.
- Once I finished my SFI proposal, my interest in *performing* research flagged, even though my interest in the subject remains strong. I wish I had something else that would nudge me towards getting things done outside of the whims of my interest.

> What helped me? What worked to create those successes?

- Having my teammates to be accountable to allowed me to experience the worst of my urges without doing anything about them. Now that I’ve done it once, I have an understanding of where the discomfort peaks, and I have demonstrated my ability to sit with them.
- The fact that Mom is spending more evenings at home. I am deterred by the guilt and trouble I have to go through when she is here.

> What am I going to *keep* doing?

- I am going to keep practicing discipline with working, and building my way up to a healthy productivity routine.
- I am going to continue branching out with my interests and making an effort to learn new things.

> What am I going to *stop* doing?

- I am going to stop pushing through feelings of frustration or tiredness when working, unless I absolutely must make a deadline. Instead, I will take a brief pause or stop altogether for the day, depending on how late it is.

> What am I going to *start* doing?

- I am going to practice pausing throughout the day, even if I don’t have the urge to binge.
- I am going to prioritize sticking to a regular night routine in order to make decisions toward recovery more automatic.
- I am not sure I will be able to implement this, because it’s a far cry from how I currently live, but I am going to start making a greater effort to actually see and stay in touch with my friends.

# Next week

> What are my top three goals for next week? How will I measure them?

1. Practice the pause method 3x per day, whether or not I feel the urge to binge.
2. Perform a deliberate night routine after I am done working for the day, before I do anything else to unwind.
3. Each day, I will do a bit of learning or work on something unrelated to CUMMW.

# Themed journal questions

> [[2024-01-17]]: What are the feelings you avoid the most & why?

- Guilt over money wasted on binging. This is so meta, it makes me feel like I actually have no positive effect on the world—I am a useless drain to those supporting me.
- Inadequacy in comparison to the accomplishments of my peers. I am unable to stop comparing myself to those I admire. For all my life, I have wanted to *appear* impressive, and I have never failed at this worse than I do now.
- Overwhelm at all that is out there in the world. Because I have restricted my life so much with my eating disorder, I am afraid of all that I have out there to explore.
- Embarrassment at past memories. I just don’t know how to let these feelings exist, and I don’t feel like they will subside on their own, for some reason.
- Loneliness. I feel like the amount that I am alone is really unusual and weird. I don’t want to think about yet another reason that I’ll never be like other people.

- Pick one of those feelings. Describe what the physical sensations manifest in your body. (Where is it located? is it moving or still? is there pressure or an absence of it? is it painful or something else? Is it intensifying or not? hot or cold or neutral? is it pulsating, swirling, constricting? How uncomfortable is it on a scale from 1-10?)
- Are there any thoughts attached to this feeling? If so, what are they?
- Practice feeling this feeling for 2 minutes with curiosity. Use the descriptor questions above to explore the feeling rather than shutting it out. After the 2 minutes are over, write about your experience. What did you find?
- What benefits can come from allowing the feeling you avoid most rather than trying to get rid of it?
