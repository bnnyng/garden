[[light-phone-diaries]]
# Notes

- Activated plan on 2023-12-12
- First heard of phone around when Barbie movie came out – July 2023?
- Came up again in [[What Happened to the New Internet]] as positive, “fringe” “product of the New Internet”
	- “The Light Phone is what many colloquially call a ‘dumb phone.’ It’s intentionally the opposite of what an iPhone has become. It restricts its users to only the most essential utilities of a modern internet communications device. You can call, text, listen to music or a podcast, navigate to a location, write a note, and that’s about it. No apps. No internet browser.”
	- “The thing I appreciate the most about the Light Phone is how directly it confronts what is arguably the core grievance of technology for everyday people – it’s destroying their time and attention.”

# Thoughts

2024-01-10
- Feel a weight off my shoulders, but get a rebound effect of anxiety when I do go online for the information overload.
	- Again, I’m missing out on some really interesting stuff, will have to do a cost-benefit analysis, clean up my digital presence.
	- There’s interesting stuff out there, but how do I sort through it?
- The iPhone never fit well in my pocket.
- “This is not meant to be a guide, but I’ll write a bit of a guide.”
- There are some people i don’t talk to at all now
- Give example of text with crazy punctuation

2024-01-01 – 3 weeks of use
- On usage:
	- Slow to type on, difficult to go back and fix errors in spelling once it does catch up. I use dictation, which makes my patterns super formal.
	- Hard to not be able to take photos. I carry a digital camera around with me now, which I hadn’t used since 2010. It still works fine, even if I have to tape the battery holder shut (refreshing to see it chugging along in the age of planned obsolescence)
	- Navigation, was what I was most worried about. Walking directions actually work pretty well – probably fine for NYC. Still haven’t mastered how to use when driving. See workaround below.
	- Music needs to be downloaded and personally stored. I don’t mind because I don’t really listen to music, but if you use your phone for music discovery it might be problematic. I like the philosophy of owning actual copies of media, though, instead of subscription service.
- On lifestyle change:
	- I walk outside more. I listen to podcasts while I walk because apparently this phone is really good at that.
	- I’ve read more books and papers
	- I feel spiritually liberated – not always fighting to reclaim my own cognition
	- Sometimes harder to talk to people. Sometimes funny to ask people to explain a meme or reference, sometimes pedantic. Less shared interests or casual topics of conversation.
	- I talk to fewer people, usually close friends. Need to be more intentional about having “organic” interactions when I don’t have the convenience of story swiping or DMing (I still have social media, but easy to forget it exists). I’m still working on this.
	- I find myself refreshing Goodreads or email somewhat obsessively
- On practicality:
	- I stay strapped lol – I keep my iPhone on me and use the Light plan with hotspot.
	- A lot of places only do digital tickets.
