# Discussion post

I was convinced by Proudfoot’s argument that Turing’s test frames intelligence as a response-dependent concept: a machine passes the Turing test when the adjudicator “imagines intelligence” in the machine. I found it a compelling case for not using Turing’s test to evaluate, for example, AI systems now, since most people certainly interpret its outcome as more than an emotional concept. On one hand, this definition of intelligence captures well the human idiosyncrasies of its popular use, particularly the tendency for people to attribute intelligence to agents that behave like us. On the other, this makes it not very useful for empirical investigation of the things we care about when we say something is “intelligent”—namely, how many degrees of freedom it has to exploit its environment. 

Beyond identifying intelligence in a useful way in other systems, the Turing test extends the disembodied, “brain as computer” metaphor that constrains the understanding human biological cognition—a law of qualitative structure, after [[@1976newell]], that puts constraints on both cognitive science as an empirical discipline and common definitions of what cognition is. Proudfoot’s interpretation of the Turing test avoids the modern dualism that substrate-neutral definitions of cognition suggest by conditioning the definition of intelligence on the observer; the substance of intelligence is just opinion.

- Searle’s Chinese room is fundamentally about whether a simulation of thought can be constituted thought itself
	- You would expect to see “comprehension” at the system level (e.g., the whole room)
