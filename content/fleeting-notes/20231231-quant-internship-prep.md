# Quant internship prep
---
## General advice

- **Green book** should be read cover-to-cover, will be prepared for online assessment and earlier technical rounds.

## Application components

### Experience and resume tactics
- Cold email to recruiter
- Participate in hackathons
- “Additional information” section with skills and interests

### Projects and activities

- Project examples:
	- Arbitrage opportunities in sports betting
	- “Implement SABR vol surface”
	- Monte Carlo and lattice pricers
	- Curve interpolations, numerical integrators
	- Running automated systems on betfair (horse betting) – exchange is similar to a stock exchange, run bots to “market make” the exchange (i.e., don’t take exposure on the outcome of the race)
- Popular activities:
	- Poker – learn by watching and playing; use a solver (e.g., Snowie) for theory.
	- Chess

## Interview components
### Mental math screening

- Recommendations:
	- Zetamac: 50s; “steady high 50s”
	- Rankyourbrain: 30s; expert level 40s
	- Tradermaths: 65+
- Successful stats at time of application:
	- Zetamac: 60-70; 80s
	- Rankyourbrain: 30-40; expert level 50s
	- Tradermaths: 65-70
	- Tradingjobs Optiver test: high 60s-low 70s
- Stats for current quants:
	- Zetamac: 100+
	- Rankyourbrain: 55+
	- Tradermaths: 75+
### Technical rounds
- Calculating expected values
### Final rounds
- Emphasize studying **game theory** and **market making**

## Notes

- Jane Street employee interviews
	- Basic statistics and probability, discrete math, other specializations
	- Probability and game theory, problem-solving skills (usually no domain knowledge)
	- Research group:
		- Do research for own edification! – examples: quantum information theory, machine learning for clinical applications
	- Research topics:
		- Low signal-to-noise ratios, large amounts of data
	- Interviewing:
		- Look at mock interviews!
		- Think about *collaborating* with the interviewer when problem solving
