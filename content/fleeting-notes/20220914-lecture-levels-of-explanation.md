# Lecture: Levels of explanation

## Describing mental computations
- Cellular-level descriptions are simple associations between certain stimuli and neural activity. When a neuron fires, it represents certain properties in the world.
- Cellular-level descriptions do not explain *why* responses happen.
- Donkey Kong game
	- Demonstrated that neural activity wasn't related the game's rules.
	- Conclusion: A cellular-level, "reductionist" approach to understanding cognition is wrong.

## Marr's levels of abstraction
- Measurements must target questions at appropriate level of abstraction; studying implementations can be extremely difficult without developing theories at higher levels
- **Computational:** What are the goals of the system? Inputs and outputs?
- **Algorithmic:** What representation does the system use (semantics)? How are representations *transformed* (algorithms)?
- **Implementational:** How are operations physically implemented?

## Pylyshyn's tri-level hypothesis
- How does a system accomplish its input and output?
- **Knowledge/semantic:** How does the system represent external properties of the world?
- **Symbolic/syntactic**
- **Biological/physical**
