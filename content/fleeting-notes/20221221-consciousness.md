# Class notes: Consciousness
---
## Key terms

- **Phenomenal consciousness** = subjective experiential states, phenomenology.
	- **Qualia** = individual instance of subjective, conscious experience arising from perceptions.
- **Access consciousness** = information that is globally available for reasoning and report.

## Scientific theories of consciousness

#### Recurrent processing theory
- Visual input is processed in an *unconscious* **feedforward sweep**, which includes the functions of **feature extraction** and **categorization**.
- **Localized recurrent processing** organizes visual input into a **conscious percept**.
- Processing is called **recurrent** because there is feedback between cortexes.
- **Widespread recurrent processing** involve functions of memory and awareness, making conscious precepts *reportable.*

#### Higher-order theory
- Consciousness requires self-awareness.
- **Lower-order representations** are accessed by the **prefrontal cortex** to develop a **meta-representation.**

#### Global workspace theory
- Consciousness requires the brain to be used as a **global workspace.**
- Representations should be accessible from the entire workspace, not just the prefrontal cortex.
- When *mobilized*, **local processors** broadcast representations that *ignite* the **global workspace**.

#### Integrated information theory
- Based on the observation that anesthesia suppresses certain patterns of neural activity in unconscious patients.
- Consciousness is a *measurement* of how a network is connected.
- In the brain, consciousness comes from the connection in a **posterior cortical "hot zone"**, while neural activity outside of the main complex is unrelated to consciousness.
- Connectivity can be measured in non-biological systems, such as the universe.

## Study questions

#### Readings quiz
- According to Jackson, is consciousness physical or not?
	- Does Jackson believe consciousness necessarily has physical effects?
- What is the philosophical argument presented in the example of Mary, a scientist who has lived her entire life in a black-and-white room?
- In Gazzaniga's experiments with split-brain patients, which hemisphere is responsible for vision and which is responsible for hearing?
	- If an object is only visible on the left side of a patient, will they be able to report it?

#### Lecture
- In each of the following examples, is **phenomenal** or **access** consciousness missing? Why?
	- **Change blindness** = failure to consciously observe change in a stimulus.
	- **Visual neglect** = a neuropsychological disorder where patients do not respond to stimuli in part of their visual field, which does not have a purely neurological explanation.
	- **Blindsight** = the ability to respond to visual stimuli while reporting blindness.
- Give an objection to the premises of Jackson's argument using Mary in the black-and-white room.
- In what sense is consciousness usually unified? How do split-brain patients fit this theory?
- How do the **recurrent processing**, **higher-order**, **global workspace**, and **integrated information** theories of consciousness differ from one another?
- Which scientific theories would suggest snails are or are not conscious?
- Which scientific theories might help us determine if a machine is indeed conscious?
