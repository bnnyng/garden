# Reflection essay


[[@2016warrant]] describes how multiple levels of sensory processing in the brain show matched filtering, or particular physical structure that selectively determines what information is processed and what is discarded. Matched filtering falls under the larger category of metabolic optimizations discussed in last week’s readings: the most obvious examples of matched filtering are in organisms with “compact nervous systems and limited energy budgets”. The examples of sexual dimorphism in blowflies and those given in “Matched filtering can also be a liability,” were particularly interesting to me from an “embodied computation” perspective, which is one of the alternatives to computationalism (i.e., the brain is an information-processing system, and mentality is both substrate-agnostic and multiply realized) in cognitive science I have been thinking about lately. Embodied computation (different from embodied/situated cognition) assumes that agents self-organize into different *physical* states with different degrees of freedom, which determine the information represented; further, living agents physically reproduce redundancies in their environment (a stronger form of adaptive coupling?) ([[@2022kelty-stephen|Kelty-Stephen et al., 2022]]). I think that this is a neat lens through which to understand matched filtering: filters reproduce patterns in stimuli (e.g., the four literally pattern-specific channels in the frog’s eye discovered by [[@1959lettvin]]); the more matched the filter, the fewer degrees of freedom to represent different kinds of information. The blowfly and liability examples in particular involve organisms filtering information about other organisms (matched filters matching matched filters?), and I wonder how the dynamics of this might differ from matching with non-”computational” aspects of the environment. The situation is almost paradoxical: a specified organism has greater freedom to exploit the matched morphology of another, but evolving to do so reduces its freedom (is matching ever reversible?).

I also hope to look into the Kriegeskorte paper mentioned at the end of [[@2021lindsay]]  (full disclosure, I was a research assistant for Dr. Lindsay a few summers ago). I am somewhat skeptical of convolutional neural networks as a model for visual processing—the common opposition of model as prediction vs. model as explanation—which, from a skim, Kriegeskorte does address? In particular, I am not sure what the CNN activation being similar to biological visual system activation is meant to tell us. We clearly are able to look at the brain to make this comparison, so the model doesn’t tell us anything new about brain activation. At higher levels, the CNN does not resolve the issue of how to pass from physical neurons firing to coarser cognitive phenomena (e.g., the “no backprop in the brain” critique).

#### Sensory matched filters

- Human “social” filtering (connection to [[PSYC-UN2435|Social Neuroscience]]), social brain hypothesis – other animals do not have such complex social dynamics
	- Non-sensory filtering?
