# Summary

The SMS framework is applied to establish the benefit of two heuristics that are not compatible with [[Probabilistic reasoning|Bayesian epistemology]]: stronger belief in a hypothesis with multiple lines of reasoning, and [[Abduction is going from a believed conclusion to requirements for the conclusion to be true, after Peirce|abductive inference]].

# Atomic notes

- [[Abstract reasoning in science is normatively constrained by the physical universe, while in math it is not]]
	- Scientists are embedded, mathematicians are not

# Key terms

- **[[Stochastic mathematical system]] (SMS)** = “stochastic processes that generate pairs of questions and associated answers, with no explicit referents.”
	- **Referent** = the thing being signified in a “reference” relationship between symbol and object.
- **[[Abduction is going from a believed conclusion to requirements for the conclusion to be true, after Peirce|Abduction]]** = using the explanatory power of a claim to infer its probability of being correct.

# Notes

## Motivation

- Mathematicians and scientists acquire knowledge by mapping a set of “almost inconvertibly true” propositions to beliefs about propositions that are not yet settled.
- As the mathematician or scientist conducts research, the set of *established facts* and the set of *beliefs* evolves over time. Further, their *reasoning* about questions they investigate and explanations they provide is a *stochastic process*.
- Real mathematicians and scientists are not limited to a single formal system, such as Bayesian probabilistic reasoning, when forming the propositions they are investigating $\to$ both “settled facts” and “unsettled propositions” are represented as *question-answer pairs* without a specified formal system.

>[!question] #concept-question What are the differences in formalizing “established facts,” “propositions they are investigating,” and “set of beliefs about non-settled facts”?

- “Mathematicians is what mathematicians do.” When using the SMS model to represent mathematics itself, this implies that there is no unique answer to a mathematical question; instead, there is a “non-degenerate objective distribution over possible answers.”

>[!question] #concept-question What is a non-degenerate distribution (support of the same dimension)? How is it related to the concept of an isomorphism for non-degenerate functions?

- The physical universe is a mathematical object.

## The SMS model

### Overview

- Settled facts and unsettled propositions are represented as question-answer pairs.
- Agents’ epistemic positions—that is, whether the facts are settled or not—are represented as the distribution over possible answers [[Conditional probability and Bayes' theorem|conditioned]] on specific associated questions and a set of set of established facts (question-answer pairs).
	- Notice that for established facts, the conditional probably of the answer given the question is one.
- The evolution of distributions over question-answer pairs is modeled using a **stochastic mathematical system (SMS)**, which generates successive sets of question-answer pairs.


## Assumptions





- SMSs capture how the question-answer pairs that scientists and mathematicians reason about *evolve* over time.


- Normative constraints
- Math vs. scientific accuracy
- Approach to modeling both descriptive and normative aspects of reasoning

- Observations only have to be [[Isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the “real” world. (inspirational facts).
