# Overview

Chomsky’s theory of innate knowledge for language is an answer to fundamental questions about the relation between language and human nature. As stated in [[@1994jackendoff]]:
> - What does human language have to be like to account for the fact that we can all speak and understand a language?
> - What are the *prerequisites* for language? What do we need in order to be able to talk?



#wip define poverty of the stimulus

In general, arguments for “poverty of the stimulus”

BFG: “Should not get cognitive science degree without understanding Chomsky’s points.”

# Key terms

From [[@1994jackendoff]]:
- **Expressive variety of language** = “the number of different things we can say by combining words in different ways”; the expressive variety of language implies the existence of **mental grammar**, or unconscious grammatical principles in the brain.
- **Mental grammar** = the complete collection of recursive patterns that determine the possible sentences for a given language, stored in individual human memory; “the notion of a mental grammar stored in the brain of a language user is *the* central theoretical construct of modern linguistics.”
- **Innate knowledge** = knowledge that is not learned, which is composed of both “special purpose endowment for language” and “general properties of the mind”; innate knowledge is needed to *solve the Paradox of Language Acquisition.*
- **Universal grammar (UG)** = innate knowledge about language that humans are equipped with from birth, which is used to find patterns in language in the environment to construct **mental grammar** in the mind of an individual; this innate knowledge is called *universal* because it must be capable of constructing a mental grammar for *any* human language.
- **Poverty of the stimulus** = the argument that there exist aspects of language that children could not possibly learn from evidence in their environment, so knowledge of these aspects must be innate.

# Evidence for “poverty of the stimulus”


- Against behaviorism/associationism
- The critical period (appealing to plasticity)?
	- Why does the critical period go away? Chomsky’s explanation? ([[Cognitive signposts]] limit us?)
## Pidgin languages and creole

- **Pidgin languages** may form when communities of different languages live in close proximity with each other.
