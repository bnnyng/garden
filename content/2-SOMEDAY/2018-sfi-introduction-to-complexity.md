# Summary

[[RAW-20231221-introduction-to-complexity|Highlights]]

Broadly, complex systems are self-organized systems of relatively simple components that demonstrate nonlinear interactions and interdependence. Complex systems have certain emergent properties, which can only be understood at the global or system level. Emergent properties may include hierarchical organization, global information processing, dynamics which cannot be encapsulated by simple equations, and the ability to adapt to changes in the environment.

# Key terms
- **Agents** = simple components that compose complex systems.
- **Emergent** = [[Emergent property|Emergent property]].
	- **Information processing** = when the system collectively gains information about environment and its own state and uses this information, again collectively, to make decisions about what actions to take.
- **Dynamics** = the study of continually changing structure and behavior of systems.
- **Information** = the study of representation, symbols, and communication.
- **Computation** = the study of how systems process information and act on results.
- **Evolution** = how systems adapt to environments that change over time.

# Notes
## Introduction to the study of complexity
- Some preliminary examples of complex systems include insect groups, the brain, the immune system, and the human genome.
	- A solitary ant is “one of the least sophisticated animals imaginable”; a colony of ants can organize to build tunnels, bridges, without any central control.
	- The brain is comprised of relatively simple neurons, but gives rise to complex behaviors like cognition, intelligence, and creativity; these neurons self-organize into [[The mind is comprised of interacting, interpretable modules|functional modules]].
- Complex systems are often networks, like food webs, social networks, and economies.

## Properties common to complex systems
- [[Complex systems are made of relatively simple agents]]
- Components of complex systems interact non-linearly.
- Complex systems display emergent properties like hierarchical organization, information processing, complex dynamics, and evolution and learning.

## Core goals, disciplines, and methodologies of the sciences of complexity
- The core disciplines and research areas in complexity are dynamics, information, and computation.
	- Note: it seems that [[Computationalist and connectionist approaches to cognition]] fits naturally into the study of complexity!
- Complex systems science has two different goals:
	- Developing mathematical and computational tools that lead to cross-disciplinary insights; for example, ant colonies as an analogy for cities.
	- Developing a general theory of complexity that unites the core disciplines. This goal is seen as unrealistic by many.
- Complex system scientists use methodologies in experimental work, theoretical work, and computer simulation.

## Definitions of complexity
- In his 1948 paper “Science and Complexity,” American mathematician Warren Weaver divides scientific problems into three categories.
	- “Problems of simplicity” involve interactions between few variables. Most of these problems were solved in the 19th and 20th centuries.
	- “Problems of disorganized complexity” involve billions or trillions of variables that can be analyzed with “statistical mechanics.” Because of limited interaction between the variables, answers about the whole can be meaningfully obtained by taking sums, or equivalently, averages of the parts.
		- Example: temperature is an average of the activity of gas molecules.
	- “Problems of organized complexity” involve moderate to large numbers of variables with strong nonlinear interactions. The variables are interrelated into emergent properties.
