>[!example] Meno’s Paradox (The Debater’s Argument)
>1. When inquiring, we either know what we're looking for or we don't.
>2. If we know what we are looking for, there is no need to inquire.
>3. If we do not know, we do not know what to look for.
>4. Hence, inquiry is impossible.

# Augustine’s “semantic version”


- According to Augustine, if teaching through **signification** is possible, then either:
	- **What we signify are further signs.** This means either:
		- The learner does not know what the sign signifies;
		- The learner does know what the sign signifies, in which case the learner already possesses the knowledge.
	- **What we signify are non-signs.** By signifying we either:
		- Exemplify something;
		- Transfer the learner's attention.
- Augustine denies the possibility of teaching through words, gesture, or self-exhibiting pantomime. Hence, teaching and learning are impossible.
- Augustine resolves the paradox by stating that Jesus Christ is the "inner teacher." 
	- The inner teacher allows individuals to gain new knowledge of **inferences**, or **conceptual knowledge**.
	- **Inferences** cannot otherwise be transferred *between* individuals.

#### Argument reconstruction

1. An individual has knowledge of what concept X is or does not (10.33, 125). 
2. If an individual has knowledge of what X is, they cannot be taught what X is (10.34, 140). 
3. If an individual does not have knowledge of what X is and if they can be taught what X is, it must be that they can be taught it through signs or through seeing someone else demonstrate X (where X is “self-exhibiting”) (10.34,145). 
4. If an individual can be taught through signs, they can be taught through words, pointing, or both (10.35, 165; 11.36, 5). 
5. However, individuals cannot be taught through words nor be taught through pointing (11.36).
6. Hence, an individual can’t be taught through signs (from 4 and 5). 
7. Hence, if an individual does not have knowledge of what X is and if they can be taught what X is, then they can only be taught through seeing someone else demonstrate X (where X is “self-exhibiting”) (from 3 and 6). 
8. But individuals cannot be taught through seeing someone else demonstrate X (where X is “self-exhibiting”) either (11.36, 15). 
9. Hence, if an individual does not have knowledge of X, they cannot be taught what X is. 
10. Hence, individuals cannot be taught knowledge of X (i.e., conceptual knowledge) in general.
