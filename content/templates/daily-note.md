>4. Clean up environmental triggers (scale, social media, pause diet content, put away triggering items).

> Weekly goals:
> 1. Why are my weekly goals important me to *today*?
> 2. How do I need to show up *today* to achieve these goals? What action items will help me move towards my goals, and what intentional thoughts will help me get those items done?

**Goal 1:** Be relapse-free for the majority of the days in the week.

**Goal 2:** Wake up at or before 9:00 AM each day, again.

**Goal 3:** Draft all my essay responses for [[20231221-application-santa-fe-institute-undergraduate-research]].


> Themed journal question: 

- What urge protocol am I choosing to implement this week?
- What basic eating plan will I follow this week?
- What about my environment encourages behaviors or makes it more difficult to not engage in behaviors?
- How can I make recovery as easy as possible for myself?
- How can I increase friction between me and my behaviors?
