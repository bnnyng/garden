>**Emergent properties** can only be understood at the system level.

Emergent properties are collective outcomes of a system that cannot be easily understood from individual components, such as the [[Complex systems are made of relatively simple agents|relatively simple individuals]] in a [[Complex systems have nontrivial emergent and self-organizing behaviors|complex system]].

Examples of emergent properties include hierarchies, collective information processing, complex dynamics, and evolution and learning.
