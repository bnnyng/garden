>[!example] Definition: Complex conjugate
>A complex number $z = x + iy$ has the **complex conjugate** $\overline{z} = x - iy$, where the imaginary part is negated. 

The complex conjugate shares the following properties with the complex numbers in general:
- $\overline{z+w} = \overline{z} + \overline{w}$;
- $\overline{z} = z \iff z = x + i0$ ; that is, if $z$ is a real number;
- $\overline{z} = -z \iff z = 0 + iy$ ; that is, if $z$ is a purely imaginary number;
- $z \overline{z} = (x + iy)(x-iy) = x^2 + y^2 + i(yx - xy) = |z|^2$, a non-negative real number;
- $z \overline{z} = 0 \iff z = 0$.
