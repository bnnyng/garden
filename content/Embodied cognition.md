Embodied cognition investigates how cognition changes when situated in a physical environment. In the embodied approach to cognitive science, the mind and environment are a single intelligent system.

Like the traditional theory where cognition is [[Representation is describing some aspect of reality with a useful symbol|representation]], [[Simple embodied cognition assumes that cognitive systems are designed to operate on a physical world]]. At the other end of the spectrum, [[Radical embodiment claims that the mind cannot be meaningfully studied in isolation from the physical world]]. Between simple and radical embodied cognition is a “medium,” which assumes that the state of the world and our bodies shape cognition in a meaningful way, but not to the degree of transforming cognitive science.
