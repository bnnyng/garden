Since the beginning of May, I’ve been going through [[20240512-artists-way|The Artist’s Way]], a twelve-week process designed to help one achieve “creative recovery.” There is a direct parallel, likely inspired by the author Julia Cameron’s own journey to sobriety, between the Way and twelve-step recovery programs like Alcoholics Anonymous. Already, the premise of creativity as something to be “recovered” fundamentally assumes that *creative ability is some sort of birthright*; as with addiction recovery, we hope to revert to a more wholesome state, before we were corrupted by worldly distractions. The first week’s theme, “recovering a sense of safety,” involves interrogating the various expectations from parents, etc. that may have compelled one to stifle their creative impulses. 

(It is worth noting that a common criticism of twelve-step programs is that they replace one obsession with another—of course, immersing oneself in a recovery community is infinitely preferable—and, in some sense, keep people stagnant, unable to ever completely divest from their histories of addiction. On the other hand, a permanent condition is precisely the goal of creative recovery!)

In any case, faced with this assumption, we are naturally led to wonder: *Does everyone actually have the capacity to be creative?* 

The question certainly stumped me and the girls in our Week 1 reflection meeting. And frankly, I feel like I am unqualified to answer. Any semblance of creative generation I have practiced in my life as always been a form of imitation, like copying master artworks, summarizing content for [literature notes](https://by2328.github.io/garden/tags/literature-note) and [[book-reviews|book reviews]], wracking my brain to write a proof that has been solved by generations of undergraduates before me. I’m still wrestling with whether these count as actually creative acts, whatever that means. 

As a non-expert, then, it seems fruitful to proceed in a Socratic manner—Socrates being the classic \[something, eternal learner?]—and interrogate the origins of the thing we want to define. We may ask instead: *What are the origins and conditions of creativity? What does it actually take to achieve?*

One common thread is that mastery of craft is required for creative independence. Abstract artists are often very capable draftsmen. Improvisation in music requires thorough understanding of music theory, whether formally trained or intuited. People generally expect writers to be prolific readers, and mock writers who are not (thank you, last year’s Twitter discourse). 

- If I wanted to be more generous I would say that this is what I am going for, but I don’t really know. I don’t have an impulse to improvise.

But an excellent end product is not the same thing as practicing creativity. No one is stopped from improvising poorly. I would say the guys selling custom T-shirts at the park are doing creative things, but I don’t think their T-shirts look good. Exceptional craftsmanship might be necessary to be canonized like a Pablo Picasso or a Louis Armstrong, but it seems disingenuous for a “creative” to aspire to anything besides creating for its own sake \[speaking purely to the notion of creativity, of course, and not practical demands like self-sufficiency]. Maybe this is just \[an association I am making, etc.], but I know plenty of people who are so prolific that I cannot help but think of them as creative. 



- So prolific that I can’t help but think of them as creative. Sheer deluge of output
	- Deriving satisfaction from the act of creating
- So why do I do this? Is it merely desire?
- So, it seems that a desire to be creative is sufficient? 
- Being a “creative” sounds silly but it is what I am going for here



You need to completely understand the machine to take it apart.

- One sees this in art, with deconstruction of skill
- Also, what is a creative?
- Julia Cameron says that critics are just silent artists, I felt targeted!

- imitation and developing skill as a step to mastery, only then capable of being creative

- Best to proceed in a Socratic manner, by asking how to actually achieve creativity.

- at least, me and the group of girls meeting up were led to wonder this. But we were fairly stumped. Silence.
- well, much to think about, I said.


- I have never felt truly creative, always like I am copying. Particularly contentious
