# ODS note-taking guidelines

Note-taking services are approved and coordinated by Disability Services (DS) as a reasonable accommodation based on the review of a studentâ€™s disability documentation. As a paid note taker, you are expected to carefully review the following information.
1. Arrive on time to class and neatly write or type all relevant information, including lecture information from the instructor, information on the board/projector, test and quiz dates, assignments, etc.
 2. In the event of an absence from class, please obtain notes within one week from another student and ensure that they are of good quality. 
 3. Students receiving notes are instructed not to reproduce or share the notes they receive. Note takers are not expected to tutor, provide notes taken from course reading materials or other personal services.
 4. Some DS students prefer to remain anonymous while others may contact you directly if they have questions. Should a student for whom you are taking notes contact you directly, please respect their confidentiality and do not disclose his/her name or their disability status (if shared with you). Please contact DS if student receiving notes contacts you regarding additional assistance.
 5. If for some reason the DS registered student no longer requires notes, you will be notified.
6. The stipend for note-taking is $250 for all full semester courses. The rate is $125 for half semester courses.
7. In order to receive compensation, note takers must complete the appropriate forms, within 5 business days of hire date.

UNDERGRADUATE NOTE TAKERS: Notes must be emailed to odsnotes@cumc.columbia.edu. The deadline for submitting your notes is the day following the final class each week for the course (e.g. If you have a Tues/ Thur class, your notes are due Thursday after class). If you withdraw from the course, please inform DS immediately so that a replacement note taker can be hired.

GRADUATE NOTE TAKERS: Please follow the procedures outlined by our Liaison (the administrator who offered you the notetaking stipend). Do not email your notes to odsnotes@cumc.columbia.edu. If you need to withdraw from the course, please inform our Liaison immediately so that a replacement can be hired. 

For payment questions, please email cumsnotespayment@cumc.columbia.edu.
For other questions or concerns, please email odsnotes@cumc.columbia.edu.
