# October 21 – Proposal

- Dopamine is more than just reward prediction
	- “Traditional” theories from [[@2016schultz]]
	- More general theme – complicating the [[The neuron doctrine and beyond|neuron doctrine]] picture, see [[@2005bullock]]
	- Dopamine matches the firing rate of policy learning RL [[@2023coddington]]
	- Dopamine is used internally to promote behaviors, similar to if evoked externally by reward [[@2023markowitz]]
		- Relationship to [[Intrinsically motivated reinforcement learning|intrinsically motivated reinforcement learning]]?
- Relationship between hippocampal place/grid cells and RL?
	- Hippocampus is a predictive map related to RL ([[@2017stachenfeld]], [[@2020geerts]])
