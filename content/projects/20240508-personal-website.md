# Inspiration

### Collections

- [Brutalist Websites](https://brutalistwebsites.com/) – “ruggedness and lack of concern to look comfortable or easy, a response to the lightness, optimism, and frivolity of today’s web design”
- [Gossip’s Web](https://gossipsweb.net/) – the directory of handmade webpages
- [The HTML Review](https://thehtml.review/about) – journal of literature made to exist on the web

### General inspiration
- [molly](https://www.m-o-l-l-y.com/)

### Piecewise inspiration

- [Spencer’s Spot](https://spencer.place/about/)
	- Objects that visitors can interact with; love the idea of digitally immortalizing some “favorite” objects
	- Website reveals more features with more visits
- [Ben Lacroix](https://benlacroix.com/)
	- Pixel aesthetic
	- Emulates desktop interface
- [Alex Miller’s Garden](https://alex.miller.garden/)
	- Interactive petri dish!

- Some design elements I really love
	- [Gift interfaces](https://www.are.na/elan-kiderman-ullendorff/gift-interfaces) – ability for visitors to leave notes, records of who came before
		- A digital version of the little free library?
		- [Gift circles](https://www.shareable.net/a-circle-of-gifts/) – make a permanent note?
- Digital garden vs. commonplace book
- Current idea: a collection of my favorite objects done in pixel art, let them fall to the bottom of the page but also be rearranged by users?
