# ‚õÖ Dream self script

## Health
- I have healed from my eating disorder, and food does not preoccupy me.
## Presentation
- I invest in forehead and masseter Botox to prevent development of additional lines and refine my face shape.
- My hair is relatively healthy due to regular care and protein treatments, like Olaplex.
- My fashion style involves tasteful and slightly unconventional designer pieces, mostly Ann Demeulemeester and Comme de Garcon.
- I wear my retainers regularly to keep my orthodontics results.

## Career and academia
- I have a solid base of mentors who I can look to for professional help.
- I have strong relationships with my professors after being an outstanding student in their classes. These are individuals I can depend on to write high-quality letters of recommendation for me later.
- I have a plan for what my senior thesis in cognitive science will be.

## Finances
- I purchase things deliberately.

## Intellectual flourishing
- I have a basic awareness of the ‚Äúgreat books‚Äù of Western literature.

## Interests and activities
- I have a portfolio of artworks that I can display.
- I volunteer frequently because I find community service fulfilling.

## Relationships and social life
