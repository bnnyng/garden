# Content inspirations

## Vlog

### General lifestyle

- [lou/annaloubarre](https://www.youtube.com/@annaloubarre) – mid-twenties student, currently living in Paris
	- Focus on cinematic, slice-of-life clips, filmmaking over narration
	- Some live-narrated clips interspersed, but most exposition is given via captions
	- *I like the date stamps!*
- [Isabela Juliana](https://www.youtube.com/@belajuliana_) – “cozy” vlogs
	- Live narration
	- Some have monthly/seasonal structure, others are loose “daily chronicles”; *nice to not have time-dependent content?*

### College content
- [Mia](https://www.youtube.com/@miadimilano) – Barnard college senior, college vlogs
	- Narration over clips from life; advantage seems to be not centering vlogging while doing activities, minimal intrusion in organic events happening! Also gives a cute sitcom energy

### Post-grad activities

- [Leandra Yomo’s “biglaw diaries”](https://www.youtube.com/@LeandraYomo) (formerly “law school diaries”)
	- Clips of daily life over a month; live narration/no voiceover
	- Anywhere from 30 mins – 1 hour long; don’t be afraid of long form content!
	- Titles are hyper-specific; people are watching because they buy into interest about your life and activities, not because of universal/generalizable appeal (c.f. Maddie Dragsbaek)

## Advice / slice of life confessions

- [Maddie Dragsbaek’s “lover girl” brand](https://www.youtube.com/@MaddieDragsbaek/videos)
	- Titles have generalizable appeal, like “how to stop comparing yourself to everyone else”

## Tastemakers

- [Lauren Louise](https://www.youtube.com/@bigbooklady) – vlogs with specific design sensibility
	- Monthly favorites and routines

- Use Da Vinci Resolve as a free alternative to Premiere Pro
- Tried to download last week’s “vlog” footage, but not nearly enough space on hard drive (evidently the zip file was 100+ GB?). Purchased 2 TB external hard drive; not 100% sure if storage solution is appropriate
