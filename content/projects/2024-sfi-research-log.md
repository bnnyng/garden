DOOR CODE: 
# Week 1

## Jun 5 to Jun 7 – One-on-one mentor meetings

[[2024-06-05]]

- Goal is to decide on a project that establishes a link between Andrew, Marina, hopefully including mentorship from Melanie Mitchell
- Current ideas: using Marina’s computational methods for mathematics, or investigating local maximums
- Next steps: reading a lot of papers! Focus on those by SFI authors – Marina, Wolpert, and Simon DeDeo

[[2024-06-06]]

- Agent-based modeling of math epistemology
- Determining features of proofs that lead to belief or understanding
- Next steps: finish reading DeDeo and Wolpert papers, try to establish connection with DeDeo?
	- [[2023-viteri-dedeo-epistemic-phase-transitions]]
	- [[2-SOMEDAY/2023-wolpert-kinney-stochastic-model-of-math-and-science]]

[[2024-06-07]]

- Recommendations from Chris Kempes
	- Read DeDeo, Wolpert & Kinney papers
	- Reach out to James, tracing spread of physical ideas
- Next steps: 
	- Run ideas by mentors for advice (Kempes and Marina, mainly)
	- Look for ways to contact DeDeo or anyone familiar with work
	- Schedule meeting with James

[[2024-06-08]]

- Emailed Kempes, Marina, and James about both potential projects
- Began closer reading of [[2-SOMEDAY/2023-wolpert-kinney-stochastic-model-of-math-and-science]]
- Next steps: continue closer reading of [[2-SOMEDAY/2023-wolpert-kinney-stochastic-model-of-math-and-science|Wolpert & Kinney (2023)]], possibly [[2023-viteri-dedeo-epistemic-phase-transitions|Viteri & DeDeo (2023)]] such that I can have a discussion about it

	- Binary choice models – [discrete choice with social interactions (2022)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0267083), [binary choice (2022)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-072X/ac8c78/pdf)
	- Formal models of social disagreement in science (Seselja, 2022)

# Week 2

## Jun 10 to Jun 11 – Write project abstract

[[2024-06-10]]

- Meeting with James
	- Possible to collect the relevant data?
		- Proof ideas: Pythagorean theorem, Hopf’s Umlaufsatz
		- Scraping answers and discussions on Math Stack Exchange for social consensus on proofs
		- “Biographical” or qualitative descriptions of the proving process (modeling piecewise?)
- Next steps
	- Prepare for tomorrow’s meeting with Chris Kempes
	- Prepare for potential meeting with DeDeo

[[2024-06-11]]

- Met with Simon DeDeo, decided on project, submitted initial project summary
- Next steps
	- Encode claims in Polymath paper
	- Continue literature review, particularly sources recommended by DeDeo
		- Michael Nielsen, *Reinventing Discovery*
		- Sid Redner’s power-law exponent
		- DeDeo AMS paper
		- Catherine Novales Duluth, *Dialogical Roots of Deduction*, general thoughts

## Jun 11 to Jun 14 – Research days

[[2024-06-12]]

- Polymath paper – exposition gives guidance on *how to think*, very little is actually captured in the statements of theorems themselves
	- Sections 4, 5, and 9 are given as “sketches” instead of formal arguments – reader is meant to come away with confidence anyway
	- Would be interesting to look at comments for why particular approaches to *conceptualization* were used
- Next steps
	- Watch *Intro Complexity* network videos
	- Continue literature review on philosophy of math, group reasoning; finish papers recommended by DeDeo
	- Look into MG’s work on collective decision-making
	- Look at degree distribution, compute power-law exponent
	- Ask Alex for network help

[[2024-06-13]]

- Watched *Intro Complexity* section on networks – [[20240613-lecture-networks]]
- Performed basic analysis on graph of explicitly cited claims, with all relations
	- Found $\alpha = 2.134, \ \sigma=0.242$; 27 nodes and 28 links 
- Next steps
	- Understand relevance of Redner “generative assembly model” paper – the communal reasoning composition as a network that grows slowly over time? Where to draw the distinction between a well-formed proof “piece” that is added to the overall argument?
	- Talk to Mirta Galesic about collective problem-solving – how do these sorts of things scale? Categorically different situation when goal is this cohesive?
	- Look into sources of comments for [[Polymath project]] – [polymath1](https://gowers.wordpress.com/category/polymath1/)

[[2024-06-14]]

- Project meeting day
	- Continue literature review
	- Look at blog posts, start thinking of a taxonomy of social interactions (c.f. the taxonomy of scientific social interactions from Marina’s work?)
- Next steps
	- Finish book on dialogical proving
	- Start looking at blog posts and comments

# Week 3

[[2024-06-17]]

- Flash talk tutorial takeaways
	- Include project plans for feedback
	- Humor is good, as well as intentionally re-engaging the audience at topical transitions
	- Keep a forward momentum, try not to flip back to previous slides
	- Tell an overarching story
	- To practice or not to practice?
- More literature review
	- [What makes Individual I's a Collective We; Coordination mechanisms & costs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02113#:~:text=What%20makes%20Individual%20I's%20a%20Collective%20We%3B%20Coordination%20mechanisms%20%26%20costs,-Jisung%20Yoon%2C%20Chris&text=Collectives%20must%20coordinate%20and%20regulate,the%20sum%20of%20individual%20abilities.)
	- [The Polymath Project: Lessons from a Successful Online Collaboration in Mathematics](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jcransh/papers/cranshaw_kittur.pdf)
	- [Internet Collaboration on Extremely Difficult Problems: Research versus Olympiad Questions on the Polymath Site](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/www16-polymath.pdf)
