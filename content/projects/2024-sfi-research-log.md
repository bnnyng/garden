- Current ideas: using Marina’s computational methods for mathematics, or investigating local maximums
- Next steps: reading a lot of papers! Focus on those by SFI authors – Marina, Wolpert, and Simon DeDeo

[[2024-06-06]]

- Agent-based modeling of math epistemology
- Determining features of proofs that lead to belief or understanding
- Next steps: finish reading DeDeo and Wolpert papers, try to establish connection with DeDeo?
	- [[2023-viteri-dedeo-epistemic-phase-transitions]]
	- [[2-SOMEDAY/2023-wolpert-kinney-stochastic-model-of-math-and-science]]

	- Possible to collect the relevant data?
		- Proof ideas: Pythagorean theorem, Hopf’s Umlaufsatz
		- Scraping answers and discussions on Math Stack Exchange for social consensus on proofs
		- “Biographical” or qualitative descriptions of the proving process (modeling piecewise?)
- Next steps
	- Prepare for tomorrow’s meeting with Chris Kempes

- Next steps
	- Encode claims in Polymath paper
	- Continue literature review, particularly sources recommended by DeDeo
		- Michael Nielsen, *Reinventing Discovery*
		- Sid Redner’s power-law exponent
		- DeDeo AMS paper
		- Catherine Novales Duluth, *Dialogical Roots of Deduction*, general thoughts

## Jun 11 to Jun 14 – Research days

[[2024-06-12]]

- Polymath paper – exposition gives guidance on *how to think*, very little is actually captured in the statements of theorems themselves
	- Sections 4, 5, and 9 are given as “sketches” instead of formal arguments – reader is meant to come away with confidence anyway
	- Would be interesting to look at comments for why particular approaches to *conceptualization* were used
- Next steps
	- Watch *Intro Complexity* network videos
	- Continue literature review on philosophy of math, group reasoning; finish papers recommended by DeDeo
	- Look into MG’s work on collective decision-making
	- Look at degree distribution, compute power-law exponent
	- Ask Alex for network help

[[2024-06-13]]

- Watched *Intro Complexity* section on networks – [[20240613-lecture-networks]]
- Performed basic analysis on graph of explicitly cited claims, with all relations
	- Found $\alpha = 2.134, \ \sigma=0.242$; 27 nodes and 28 links 
- Next steps
	- Understand relevance of Redner “generative assembly model” paper – the communal reasoning composition as a network that grows slowly over time? Where to draw the distinction between a well-formed proof “piece” that is added to the overall argument?
	- Talk to Mirta Galesic about collective problem-solving – how do these sorts of things scale? Categorically different situation when goal is this cohesive?
	- Look into sources of comments for [[Polymath projectss]] – [polymath1](https://gowers.wordpress.com/category/polymath1/)

[[2024-06-14]]

- Project meeting day
	- Continue literature review
	- Look at blog posts, start thinking of a taxonomy of social interactions (c.f. the taxonomy of scientific social interactions from Marina’s work?)
- Next steps
	- Finish book on dialogical proving
	- Start looking at blog posts and comments

---
# Week 3

[[2024-06-18]]

- Tutorial takeaways – flash talks
	- Include project plans for feedback
	- Humor is good, as well as intentionally re-engaging the audience at topical transitions
	- Keep a forward momentum, try not to flip back to previous slides
	- Tell an overarching story
	- To practice or not to practice?
- Meeting with Simon & Marina
	- Ideas
		- Hidden Markov model of reply threads – comment emits one argument pattern, replies emit another; possibility that there are 6 argument patterns but 3 hidden states, etc; more general look at how argumentation happens
		- Identifying how confidence is established, e.g. presence of enthymematic gaps
	- Next steps
		- Scrape posts for comment data
		- Implement Na clustering technique
		- Continue literature review to identify significant suggested reasoning processes (e.g., Type 1 vs. Type 2 methods of establishing confidence, [[Deductive dialogues are Prover-Skeptic games, after Dutilh Novaes|Prover-Skeptic]] framework) and “argument” types (e.g., counterexamples, probabilistic reasoning)

[[2024-06-19]]

- Tutorial takeaways – organization and project management
	- Storage
		- PCloud for secure cloud storage
	- Preparing code for publication
		- File structure: under a “repos” folder, keep repositories per project
		- README file can be done any time during process
		- Example: subfolders for figure-producing scripts, MatLab functions, figures that are automatically generated by scripts, “schematic” or non-automatic figures
		- Figshare – figures and data repository, useful for large datasets
		- Archive to DOI
- Scraped data from all threads related to Polymath1
	- Data for each comment contains: author, date and time string, comment content; date and time stored in correct type
- Suggestions for potential analysis
	- ? – vectorize and examine vector space movement (?)
	- Sara Walker – compare number of comments that are “memory” to what is truly novel
		- What counts as novel, if mathematics is deductively built?
- Next steps
	- Start parsing out reply chain – account for comment replies in dataset
	- Get suggestions for how to interpret comment content
	- Share code with Simon and Marina over GitHub

[[2024-06-20]]

- Added more information for each comment
	- Custom ID, e.g., `G300-1000` for Gowers comment 1000 on post 300
	- References to parent comment if in blog “reply” structure (`in-reply-to`, `in-reply-to-href`)
	- Links to comment itself, and author if available

[[2024-06-21]]

- Contemplating assembly theory perspective and math – mostly reading day (didn’t feel very productive, however)
- Meeting with Marina & Simon – see daily note
	- Topical modeling how-to
- Next steps
	- Make a text file for all relevant blog links
	- Finish collecting *clean* data for as many projects as possible

# Week 4 - Flash talks

[[2024-06-24]]

- Saving URLs
	- For consistency, only saved “research” threads that were officially tagged under the project name for each blog
	- Omitted comments to published papers for now, since the interaction is not fully captured in the comments (but can add)?
- Tentatively scraped all comments, reasons for inconsistency with Kloumann paper?
- Next steps
	- Add project id column
	- Include up/down vote data

---
# Further notes

- Potential avenues of investigation
	- Does interaction change as people get more familiar with online etiquette?- Added more information for each comment
	- Custom ID, e.g., `G300-1000` for Gowers comment 1000 on post 300
	- References to parent comment if in blog “reply” structure (`in-reply-to`, `in-reply-to-href`)
	- Links to comment itself, and author if available

[[2024-06-25]]

- Meeting with Simon and Marina
	- Clean comments for topic modeling – remove LaTeX for now, change to all lowercase, possibly standardize tenses?
	- Get word counts and remove top words
	- Start “quick and dirty” topic modeling
- Slack discussion – potential plots 
	- “The distribution of the length of comments in words; this might tell us a little bit about the “norms” of the system. My guess is that it will look rather Poissonian (with a characteristic length that indicates a target), rather than exponential (implying a constant “probability of stopping”) or power law (indicating more complex processes beloved of the Santa Fe Institute).”
	- “A scatter plot of “number of non-Latex words” versus “number of Latex equations”, that might separate out “business posts” from more discursive ones”
- Debugging for web scraping
	- Fixed replies for Polymath blog
	- Changed LaTeX to print alt text, bracketed by $s
- Starting topic modeling
	- Downloaded necessary packages – will probably have to work from command line
	- Consolidated and cleaned all comment *content* – did not remove single characters or numbers
- Next steps
	- Decide which of the most common words to remove from content – check if I should use a single “document”
	- Run quick start topic model using the command line

[[2024-06-27]]

[[2024-06-28]]

- Meeting with Simon & Marina
	- Current stage is “playing around”; aim to get “cognitive move” word list
	- Interviewing real people about how they conduct math, take inspiration from [[2024-dedeo-alephzero-and-mathematical-experience]]
- Topic modeling
	- Redid model with a large number of topics (100)
	- Filtered comments for words not shared across projects; in particular, words not used at least three times in all *main* Polymaths

	- Try a smaller number of topics (5-10)
	- Get top comment examples for each topic

---
# Week 5

[[2024-07-01]]

- Retrieved top comments for 10 topics with shared words only
	- Possibly too constrained? Instead, try words that appear in 50 percent of Polymaths, standardizing words
- Made general plots for data
	- Distributions of comment lengths (number of words)
	- Number of words vs. number of TeX equations
- Next steps
	- Examine example comments and get a sense of topic classifications


[[2024-07-02]]
- Meeting with Simon and Marina
	- Make final word filtered list, then train topic model again
	- Adjust hyperparameters during training
	- Aim for smaller number of categories to be more interpretable—look for log-likelihood asymptote
- Reading recommendations from Simon
	- “The Birth of a Theorem”
	- Rota, “Indiscrete Thoughts”
	- Ruben Hirsch
- Finalizing word list
	- Inspecting top 15 comments from each previously assigned topic, adding words to keep based on original text and *removing* words based on filtered content; general heuristic is to remove words highly associated with categories that seem to be about one math topic
- Next steps
	- Finalize word list
	- Retrain topics, adjusting hyperparameters and looking at log-likelihood asymptote for optimal numbers
	- Create Overleaf document and appendix with examples for each topic
	- Try working with bi-grams

[[2024-07-03]]
- Finalizing word list – see daily note for heuristics

- Next steps
	- Put results in an Overleaf document

[[2024-07-05]]

- Running anchored CorEx models – see daily note
- Meeting with Simon and Marina
	- Further word filtering
	- Use domain knowledge to come up with “anchor words”
	- Verify by running unsupervised model on the documents with top 100 words from each topic, etc.
- Next steps
	- Come up with list of questions to ask mathematicians
	- Data preprocessing for CorEx – use higher minimum bi-gram ratio

---
# Week 6

[[2024-07-08]]
- Trying contextual/combined models
- Next steps
	- Solidify topics and decide on metrics for evaluation
	- Clarify next directions for research

[[2024-07-09]]
