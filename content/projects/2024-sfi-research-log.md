# Week 1

## Jun 5 to Jun 7 – One-on-one mentor meetings

[[2024-06-05]]

- Goal is to decide on a project that establishes a link between Andrew, Marina, hopefully including mentorship from Melanie Mitchell
- Current ideas: using Marina’s computational methods for mathematics, or investigating local maximums
- Next steps: reading a lot of papers! Focus on those by SFI authors – Marina, Wolpert, and Simon DeDeo
