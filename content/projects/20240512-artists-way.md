## Week 1

- Question: does everyone has the potential to be creative?
- Mostly consistent with morning pages
- Didnâ€™t do a meaningful, creativity-generating Artist Date, but certainly took time to myself
- Not really resonating with the needing a sense of safety

## Week 2

- Doing my book reviews is a form of creativity? Thanks, Anna! Is my synthesis and note-taking also a form of creativity?
- Starting to brainstorm writing topics and think deeply about dream lives
- Fantasizing about architecture classes and planning my courses around it
