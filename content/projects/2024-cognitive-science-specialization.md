# Complexity science

#### [Favela & Amon (2023), “Reframing Cognitive Science as a Complexity Science”](https://doi.org/10.1111/cogs.13280)

- Complexity science has three main contributing fields: systems theory, nonlinear dynamical systems, and synergetics
	- **Systems theory** = “the study of abstract organizational principles”; core lessons in Wiener (1948)
	- **Nonlinear dynamical systems theory (NDST)** = mathematical study for variables that change over time (Strogatz, 2015; Tuller, Case, Ding, & Kelso 1994)
	- **Synergetics** = general principles for systems that have “spontaneous processes and structures” found by investigating “contextually defined macroscopic and microscopic spatial and temporal features”
- Examples of the utility of complexity science
	- Experimental investigation of [[Embodied cognition|embodied cognition]], e.g., assessing if extended systems have the same nonlinearity and self-organization of single functional systems
	- Neuronal avalanches
	- Energy requirements for artificial vs. biological cognition
