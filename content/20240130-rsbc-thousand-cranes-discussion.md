# Questions

- What does each character represent?
- What is the significance of the birthmark, essentially sandwiching the novel? How does the theme of marking (also with the bowl) figure in the novel?
	- Note that the birthmark is a “permanent” attribute of a temporary person, while the lipstick stain is a later addition to a historical object.
- What is the significance of historical, old objects? 
	- Decision by the translator to include historical periods? Either way, had a significant impact on reading experience.
	- As objects are passed from person to person, so too are the roles from parents to offspring. K frequently wonders about what individuals have owned the bowls.

>“A tea ceremony is a coming together in feeling, a meeting of good comrades in a good season. I may say in passing, that to see my novel _Thousand Cranes_ as an evocation of the formal and spiritual beauty of the tea ceremony is a misreading. It is a negative work, and expression of doubt about and warning against the vulgarity into which the tea ceremony has fallen.”

- What are Kawabata’s attitudes towards tradition? Similar to his friend Mishima?
- What is the role of gender? Who has power, and when? Are women always “losing”?
	- K holds them all at a distance, impersonal and objectifying, yet they are the only relevant people in his life—or rather, his relationships are the only fixture.
