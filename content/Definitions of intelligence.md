## Open questions
- How important are mental models (i.e., representations used for simulation or prediction) for explaining intelligent behavior?
- Is [[System 1 and System 2 thinking]] an appropriate way to classify cognitive processes?

## Researcher perspectives

- Daniel Dennett (Tufts University, Santa Fe Institute)
	- Intelligence is the capacity to “know what to do when you don’t know what to do”; that is, intelligent agents can reason about the best solution to a particular problem, even if they cannot implement the particular competence needed.
	- Conversely, less intelligent systems may exhibit “competence without comprehension”
	- [[Intelligence is the capacity to choose between different available heuristics, after Dennett]]
- David Krakauer (Santa Fe Institute)
	- [[Intelligence is a “learned incomprehension” that comes from acquisition of expertise, after J. Krakauer]]
	- A system can be intelligent when it demonstrates domain-specific competence.
	- This interprets intelligence as a Darwinian system (?) where species-specific reasoning is interpreted in the context of their specific problems.
- Jon Krakauer (Johns Hopkins)
	- Intelligent behavior depends on automating skills learned via effortful cognition.

	- [[Intelligent reflexes are translated from propositional knowledge, after D. Krakauer]]
- [[Mitchell, Melanie|Melanie Mitchell]]
	- Intelligence uses a model of oneself and one’s environment to generate predictions and expectations.
		- #concept-question Representation vs. modeling?
	- Intelligence is related to the ability to affect the world by both manipulating physical objects and influencing others’ mental states.

	- Intelligence involves the ability to abstract from specific data and apply knowledge to analogous contexts.

	- Intelligence can be biological, human, and collective.
