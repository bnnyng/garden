According to [[Weil, Simone|Simone Weil]], risk is a necessary part of human life. Without risk, we experience “a type of boredom which paralyzes in a different way from fear, but almost as much.” However, the experience of risk must be balanced between stimulating and fatal.

>”The protection of mankind from fear and terror doesn’t imply the abolition of risk; it implies, on the contrary, the permanent presence of a certain amount of risk in all aspects of social life; for the absence of risk weakens courage to the point of leaving the soul, if the need should arise, without the slightest inner protection against fear.” — Simone Weil, *The Need for Roots*

This stands in contrast to [[Han, Byung-Chul|Byung-Chul Han’s]] claim in his essay [[2010-han-the-burnout-society|”Profound Boredom”]] that [[Idleness is needed for creative generation]].

>How are Weil’s and Han’s definitions of boredom differently characterized? Can the two perspectives be reconciled?

Weil assumes a society without sufficient scaffolding for human flourishing; Han sees construction conditions for boredom as precisely the means for development. Weil examines the affliction and grace of individuals; Han seeks to characterize modern society as a collective. Weil and Han also hail from very different historical contexts—this is most likely the main explanation for their differences.
