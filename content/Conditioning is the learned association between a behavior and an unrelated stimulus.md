In **classical conditioning**, an association is formed between an involuntary behavior and a stimulus. For example, a dog may be conditioned to salivate when a bell is rung.

In **operant conditioning**, an association is formed between a voluntary behavior and a specific consequence. The voluntary behavior is increased through reward and decreased through punishment.

#open-question *How does operant conditioning compare to reinforcement learning?*
