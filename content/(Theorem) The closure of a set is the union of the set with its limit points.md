>[!abstract] Theorem (Munkres 17.6): The closure of a set is the union of the set with its limit points
>Let $A$ be a subset of the [[Topological spaces and open sets|topological space]] $X$, and $A’$ be the set of all [[Limits and accumulation points#In topological spaces|limit points]] of $A$. Then the [[Closed sets, closures, and dense subsets#In topological spaces|closure]] of $A$ is given by $\bar A = A \cup A’$.
>
>As a corollary, a subset of topological space is closed *if and only if* it contains all of its limit points (i.e., $A’ \subseteq A$).
