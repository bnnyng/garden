>[!example] Reminder
>Be the most excellent version of myself I can be, one day at a time. If I look back on today specifically, I want to be proud of what I did and who I am.

# To do

> What are the top three *most important* things I need to do today?

- [x] Outline final talk and start preparing slides
- [ ] Look at resources for background information from Marina

----
# Menu

> What other things can I do today that are less important?
## Today

- Morning
	- [x] Literature review for final talk (~1 hour)
	- [x] Rerun analyses with more comment groups?
- Afternoon
	- [x] Figure out correct computation for radar plots
	- [x] Look into low-diversity outlier group
	- [x] Get distributions for each word in each level of the hierarchy – will use this to get titles for each reduction
- Evening
	- [ ] Decide on topic hierarchy for talk based on most interpretable groups
	- [x] Implement diversity from Dieng et al. to evaluate topics

## Future file

- [ ] Reach out to Raphael Milliere
- [ ] Re-run analyses for cognitive topics
- [x] Plot multiple hierarchical differences
- [ ] Compute novelty and transience of key comments vs. “system average”, non-key comments
- [ ] Look into Robb Rutledge in advance of visit
- [ ] Look at resources from Marina
- [ ] Make a broad write-up for our 30 topics

# Media log

#### [Slavoj Zizek – On Opera and Freedom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nh155bv1UaQ)

- Everyone has different notion of freedom – in Don Giovanni, everyone had different motivation for punishment; “freedom is up to a point an empty signifier; encompass many contradictory…”
	- The complexity and self-contradiction is precisely the reason that massive mobilization happened
	- “Never neglect the form”

# Notes

- Trying to wrap my head around how the model represents the same words (same strategies) used in different contexts (different BOWs) – possible measurement in diagnostics file?

#### Meeting with Simon and Marina

- Looking at local minimum – almost like change in 1/2 bit of information (50/50 to 75/25)?
- 

#### Diagnostics observations
- Biggest gains in diversity after reduction 
	- 10 → 9, collapsing original topic 0
	- 9 → 8, collapsing original topic 6; also, eliminated the last original topic
	- 12 → 11, collapsing original topic (collapsing original topic 23)
- Suggests that original topic 6 is the “strongest”?
- Good candidates for “granularities” to keep: 7, 
#### References for talk background from Marina

More things you could consider including on the "background" slide (see some ideas on what makes our project is unique compared to this prior literature in parentheses)!More theories of **mathematical discovery** (_these also focus on the 'individual genius' idea of mathematical discovery_):

#### Remaking radar plots with sliding subgroups

- Made negligible difference in the radar plots!

Method for plotting:
```Python
def plot_diversity_radar_subgroups(title, df, dist_col=DIST_COL, num_topics=NUM_TOPICS, num_groups=15, subgroup_size=20, sliding=True):
    df = df.reset_index(drop=True)
    group_size = int(len(df) / num_groups)
    comment_groups = [list(range(i, min(i + group_size, len(df)))) for i in range(0, len(df), group_size)]
    if len(df) % num_groups != 0:
        comment_groups = comment_groups[:-1]

    topic_labels = [i for i in range(num_topics)]
    num_columns = int(num_groups / 3)
    theta = radar_factory(num_topics, frame='polygon')
    fig, axes = plt.subplots(3, num_columns, figsize=(15, 9), subplot_kw=dict(projection='radar'), sharey=True)
    axes = axes.flatten()

    for i, group in tqdm(enumerate(comment_groups), 'Plotting average distribution per group'):
        df_group = df.iloc[group]
        if not subgroup_size or subgroup_size == 0:
            distributions = np.array(df_group[dist_col].tolist())
            group_avgs = np.mean(distributions, axis=0)
        else:
            if sliding:
                comment_subgroups = [list(range(j, j + subgroup_size)) for j in range(len(df_group) - subgroup_size + 1)]
            else:
                comment_subgroups = list(range(j, min(j + subgroup_size, len(df_group))) for j in range(0, len(df_group), subgroup_size))
            subgroup_distributions = []
            for subgroup in comment_subgroups:
                distributions = np.array(df_group.iloc[subgroup][dist_col].tolist())
                subgroup_distributions.append(np.mean(distributions, axis=0))
            if len(subgroup_distributions) > 0:
                group_avgs = np.mean(subgroup_distributions, axis=0)
        ax = axes[i]
        ax.plot(theta, group_avgs)
        ax.fill(theta, group_avgs, alpha=0.25)
        ax.set_title(f'Group {i}')
        ax.set_varlabels(topic_labels)
        plt.suptitle(title, fontsize=16)
    # plt.subplots_adjust(hspace=0.5)
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()
```
Example of calling method:
```Python
plot_diversity_radar_subgroups(
    title='Polymath1 (Gowers Only) - Average Distribution Per Group (Sliding Subgroups) - 6 Topics',
    df=df_comments,
    dist_col=f'reduced-6', 
    num_topics=6
)
```
