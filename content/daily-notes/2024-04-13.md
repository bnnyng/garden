# Notes

- Reference letter request for Dragomir
```
Hello Professor Dragomir,

I hope this email finds you well!

I am writing to request a letter of reference from you for the Shenoy Undergraduate Research Fellowship in Neuroscience. Because I am taking a gap year for 2023-2024, I know few faculty who can speak to my current work or interests. Despite only meeting and interacting briefly in January, you happen to be most familiar with my technical and collaborative skills through CUMMW and MCM, and I believe you can speak to my potential to engage in and/or benefit from the program.

Briefly, SURFiN provides a stipend for undergraduates to work at a participating neuroscience lab during the 2024-2025 school year. The project I am interested in, "Neural mechanisms of compositional planning in a macaque drawing task," specifically involves building computational models (e.g., linear classifiers, neural nets) to decode cognitive drawing plans directly from neural activity. I believe the modeling workshop directly prepared me for this lab work, in addition to the general exercising of technical writing and flexible learning (I believe we learned to use Bayesian probabilistic programming in around 1.5 days for our final solution, haha).

In case these are useful, I have attached my transcript and relevant experiences to this email. I've also included my 2024 CSUREMM statement and proposal (I withdrew my application after finding another role for this summer); these give a comprehensive view of my goals and my ability to perform literature review/come up with original projects, but are definitely optional to read because they are longer and dense.

If you feel you are unable to write a meaningful letter or would benefit from additional information (e.g., SURFiN application personal statement), please let me know as soon as you can. Otherwise, I will send you an invitation directly from the application portal. 

Thank you for your consideration!

Best,
Bonnie
