>[!example] Reminder
>Be the most excellent version of myself I can be, one day at a time. If I look back on today specifically, I want to be proud of what I did and who I am.

# To do

> What are the top three *most important* things I need to do today?

- [ ] Refine semantic corpus and get quality topics
	- [x] Get relevant URLs from Wikipedia
	- [x] Scrape and clean content from Wikipedia pages
	- [x] Train Top2Vec on posts and Wikipedia pages, then assign comment topics (with and without retraining? add Wikipedia pages before or after?)

----
# Menu

> What other things can I do today that are less important?
## Today

- [x] Break Wikipedia documents into subsections

## Future file

# Media log

# Notes

#### Extending semantic corpus

- For Wikipedia pages, need to filter out irrelevant subsections
	- Areas of mathematics: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Areas_of_mathematics
	- Fields of mathematics: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Fields_of_mathematics
- Current plan
	- Get data for both massive corpus and filtered corpus
	- Clean data
	- Remove all meta-type comments and train Top2Vec on all documents
	- Can iterate with different dataset combinations
