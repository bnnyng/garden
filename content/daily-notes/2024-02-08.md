# Notes

- Feeling kind of overwhelmed by all of my reading options at the moment, and all of the ones I have on hold as well. Not sure how to define my reading “workflow”:
	- For nonfiction books, should I keep highlighting and collecting information? Is this a useful impulse? To what end?
- Wondering about the legality of making my MCM results publicly available:

>**_Q_ Are teams allowed to publish their solution?  
 A** All contest submissions and all rights to its publication become the property of COMAP and COMAP reserves the right to use in materials relating to this contest, the names of the team members, their advisor(s), and their affiliations, without further notification, permission, or compensation.

User Friendly | Cliff Kuang | Book
- Not sure if I want to commit to reading this whole thing yet; writing style feels dry and uninformative. Maybe I can just watch an author interview?
- First chapter about Three Mile Island, second about Ripple. Honestly, I just can’t see myself internalizing much of this information, but maybe I don’t need to?
