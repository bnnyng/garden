# Notes

- A response to this poor antisocial fellow on Discord:
```

Perhaps my reading of your Google Doc isn‚Äôt as close as it could be but here are some preliminary responses:
- Don‚Äôt drink alcohol before the meeting unless you plan on drinking before all your social interactions thereafter. Maybe that‚Äôs just my personal skill issue, though. 
- The reason you are not converting acquaintances into friends is not because you are not interesting or fun enough; in fact, I‚Äôd argue that friendships on that basis turn out to be very limited and situational. I cannot think of any time that I befriended someone, or wanted to befriend someone, because they enthralled me in a single conversation. It was more that I saw them around and developed enough familiarity to have a stake in how their life was going, the cumulative effect of small interactions over a period of time‚Ä¶ yes, this is also situational at first. 
- Boring questions can certainly be a kind of intellectual ‚Äúvibe check.‚Äù But if you do feel that you‚Äôre failing spectacularly in just one interaction, it sounds like an actual sustained friendship with that person would be pretty intolerable.
- For tonight, why not let creative writing be the go-to conversation topic? Shared hobbies being the golden standard for developing friendships or whatever. If I had actual hobbies last year instead of getting to know the other people smoking outside the library as my only form of social interaction, I would have saved myself a lot of cash and lung capacity.
- I guess I just don‚Äôt think that this is something you can ‚Äúfail‚Äù in one shot. At risk of sounding really cringe, something will come out of it if you just continue to physically show up to things (I have had extremely annoying people fix themselves in my extended social circles this way); the only way to fail is to not try at all. 
```
- Spent an hour thinking and preparing for a quant internship ‚Äì I think I need to let go of this pressure, same with software engineering internships.
	- I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs maturity or immaturity that I can‚Äôt take the ‚Äúpractical‚Äù route out to a solid career or income.
	- I need to commit myself to one thing I‚Äôm interested in, and *do* more of it than what I currently am. What have I done recently that I like *doing*?
		- Some coding engineering challenges
		- Expository writing
		- Painting, I guess
		- Reading and taking notes on things
	- What do I want to try *doing* more for the next bit of time?
		- Practice and learn math
- Recovery group call notes:
	- A thought on body image: feeling dissatisfied no matter what?
- I just feel so depressed. There‚Äôs absolutely nothing really that I enjoy doing, I think. I‚Äôve been looking at ML engineering projects and I simply don‚Äôt want to do any of them, even though I would love to make the money. How can I go out in the world and do something that matters while having a stable income?
- I have 3.5 months left of my ‚Äúgap year.‚Äù How do I make the most of this experience?
	- Establish a good foundation for my physical and mental health
	- Study for quant interviews (even if I feel bad about probably not being able to get past the resume screening)
	- Study for the math classes I plan to take so that I don‚Äôt feel overwhelmed during the school year‚ÄîI want to be able to maximize my time doing everything else!
	- Read a bunch of papers to gather knowledge about the fields I want to work in, connect with researchers
	- Once I‚Äôm back in school, dial down and focus on how to make myself a successful Ph.D. applicant. I want to dedicate 100% of myself to getting into graduate school!
	- Establish basic life skills like managing my personal finance
