# Notes

#### Polymetamath regex filtering

```Python
import re

# List of n-grams
ngrams = ["machine learning", "deep learning", "neural networks", "support vector machine"]

# Sample document
document = """
Machine learning and deep learning are popular fields in artificial intelligence. 
Neural networks power many deep learning models, while support vector machines are used in classification tasks.
"""

# Function to replace spaces in n-grams with underscores
def replace_with_underscores(match):
    return match.group(0).replace(" ", "_")

# Escape and replace each n-gram with its underscored version
for ngram in ngrams:
    pattern = re.escape(ngram)
    document = re.sub(pattern, replace_with_underscores, document, flags=re.IGNORECASE)

print(document)
