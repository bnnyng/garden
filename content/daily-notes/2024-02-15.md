# Notes

- Starting a note on [[researchers]] to keep track of labs that I am interested in.
	- I am manifesting a Ph.D. student position with these. I am going to remain delusional about it.
- Some fleeting notes on ‚ÄúModels of the Mind‚Äù
	- How Rewards Guide Actions ‚Äì Temporal Difference and Reinforcement Learning
		- Sequential decision making = state positions, step actions
		- Dopamine, addiction in a RL framework
	- Grand Unified Theories of the Brain
- Added spring break trip to Spring overview in [[2024]]

[[2024-02-14]]

- UW possible spring semester courses
	- [Introduction to Differential Equations](https://myplan.uw.edu/course/#/courses/MATH%20207?states=N4Ig7gDgziBcLADrgJYDsAmB7MAJApigOYAWALsrAEwAMA7AMwA0yY62YACllCmSljSVaAVgB0DSQyoAOKgBY69GgwC%2BIVUA) ‚Äì c.f. [Ordinary Differential Equations](https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/#subj/MATH/V2030-20241-001/)
		- [UW course syllabus](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~aloveles/Math207Materials/syllabus.pdf) vs. [Columbia course syllabus](https://math.columbia.edu/~samdehority/files/2021-summer-ODEs/syllabus.pdf)‚Äì both use the Boyce, et al. text
	- Real analysis and algebra classes are too rudimentary to count for credit; look into computer science, applied math, statistics?
