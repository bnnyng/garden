Atta | Jarett Kobek | Book
- Finished this short novel last night, as well as the short story “The Whitman of Tikrit,” which imagines Saddam Hussein’s last day before capture.
- The book is based on his real master’s thesis on architecture studies; jumping point for the narrator’s many contradictions. For example:
	- He hates the architecture of modernity (mostly skyscrapers) mostly because of their *vibe*, but doesn’t consider their physical reality (people in the skyscrapers).
	- As he becomes obsessed with his faith, he is distant from everything real that his faith provides rules for. He is critical of his family. His faith cannot be embodied, same as the architectural Forms.
	- There is some personal suffering in the form of racism toward the beginning (35), but more often than not, Atta is driven by an imagined collective suffering.
	- He often speaks of violence (e.g., discussion of Odysseus on p. 53) but does not have any idea of true violence because of his privileged upbringing.
	- Insane analysis of what I imagine to be the Jungle King on p. 117. “Brother, you see the hidden meaning of everything.”
	- He criticizes worldly pleasures but, as Jarrah says on p. 126, jihad takes that place for him.
- Interesting parallel between “These are not men. They are fleas feasting on your blood” and Hussein eating ants later.
- “The Whitman of Tikrit” is a bit mythologizing, if only because I don’t know how many of the personal details are real.
