>[!example] [[20240107-bb-program-week-2|Week 2: Identifying and Changing Patterns]]
>**Intentions:**
>- Discover what worked from new routines, as well as what challenges came from them.
>- Learn more about what eating routines work, gain more awareness around my habits, and continue making progress away from behaviors.
>
>**Goals and objectives:**
>1. Review my biggest challenge with interrupting my behavior pattern and readjust based on what worked and didnâ€™t work.
>2. Make any adjustments needed to eating patterns.

> Weekly goals:
> 1. Why are my weekly goals important me to *today*?
> 2. How do I need to show up *today* to achieve these goals? What action items will help me move towards my goals, and what intentional thoughts will help me get those items done?

**Goal 1:** Use the pause method every time I get an urge, reminding myself that relapsing is a choice.

**Goal 2:** Spend a majority of evenings without relapsing.

**Goal 3:** Wake up at 9 a.m. at the latest each day.


> Themed journal question: 

- What are points you can pause during this pattern?
- How is eating consistently and eating enough helping you, and is there anything you need to adjust in your eating pattern?
- What thoughts and feelings encourage you to binge and purge?
- How do you want to intentionally think and act when urges come up, regardless of your initial reaction?
- If urges were a separate person, how would you speak to them?
