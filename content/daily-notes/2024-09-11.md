\maketitle
\subsection*{Question 1}
Let $X$ be a topological space and let $A$ be a subset of $X$ with the property that for all $x \in A$, there is an open set $U$ containing $x$ such that $U \subset A$. Show that $A$ is open in $X$.

\begin{proof}[Answer]
Since each $x \in A$ is contained in an open set $U \subset X$, we know $A$ is entirely contained by the union of all such $U$. On the other hand, since $U \subset A$ for each open set $U$ containing an element $x \in A$, we know the union of all such $U$ cannot contain elements outside of $A$. Then $A$ is precisely equal to an arbitrary union of open sets, so $A$ is also open in $X$.
\end{proof}

% TO DO: Suffices to show equality directly? Since U \subset A, their union cannot contain elements outside of A.

\subsection*{Question 2}

Show that if $Y$ is a subspace of $X$ and $A$ is a subset of $Y$, then the subspace topology $A$ inherits as a subspace of $Y$ is the same as the subspace topology $A$ inherits as a subspace of $X$.

\begin{proof}[Answer]
By definition, the subspace topology $Y$ inherits from $X$ is
$$
\mathcal T_Y = \{ \}
$$

\end{proof}
