#### [Federenko et al. (2024), “Language is primarily a tool for communication rather than thought”](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07522-w)

#### Meeting with Simon and Marina

```
Hyperparameter Optimization
--optimize-interval [NUMBER] This option turns on hyperparameter optimization, which allows the model to better fit the data by allowing some topics to be more prominent than others. Optimization every 10 iterations is reasonable. --optimize-burn-in [NUMBER] The number of iterations before hyperparameter optimization begins. Default is twice the optimize interval.
