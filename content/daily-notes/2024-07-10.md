#### Word inclusion list


- Words to categorize
```

trivial
```

- Uncertain of inclusion – include all versions of words
	- Keeping quantifiers? e.g., previously, little, entirely, totally, fully
	- Time-ordered, temporal planning? e.g., beginning, behind, step, steps
	- Alternatives/disagreement, e.g., yet, however, although

#### Topic modeling - inclusion list

- Note that the bi-gram ratio is 20 for the “inclusion” list training

```
bin\mallet import-file --input data\comments-inclusion-mallet.tsv --output inclusion.mallet --keep-sequence 
```

5 topics
```
bin\mallet train-topics --input inclusion.mallet --num-topics 5 --output-state inclusionOutput-topics5.gz --optimize-interval 10 --optimize-burn-in 20 --output-doc-topics inclusionTopics-topics5.txt --output-topic-keys inclusionKeys-topics5.txt 
```

6 topics
```
bin\mallet train-topics --input inclusion.mallet --num-topics 6 --output-state inclusionOutput-topics6.gz --optimize-interval 10 --optimize-burn-in 20 --output-doc-topics inclusionTopics-topics6.txt --output-topic-keys inclusionKeys-topics6.txt 
```


7 topics
```
bin\mallet train-topics --input inclusion.mallet --num-topics 7 --output-state inclusionOutput-topics7.gz --optimize-interval 10 --optimize-burn-in 20 --output-doc-topics inclusionTopics-topics7.txt --output-topic-keys inclusionKeys-topics7.txt 
```


10 topics
```
bin\mallet train-topics --input inclusion.mallet --num-topics 10 --output-state inclusionOutput-topics10.gz --optimize-interval 10 --optimize-burn-in 20 --output-doc-topics inclusionTopics-topics10.txt --output-topic-keys inclusionKeys-topics10.txt 
```

```
bin\mallet train-topics --input commentsBigrams20.mallet --num-topics 20 --input-state commentsOutput20.gz --no-inference --diagnostics-file diagnostics20.xml
```

#### Topic modeling - filtered list

- Note that the bi-gram ratio is 20 as well

```
bin\mallet import-file --input data\comments-mallet-bigrams-20.tsv --output filter.mallet --keep-sequence 
```

6 topics
```
bin\mallet train-topics --input filter.mallet --num-topics 6 --output-state filterOutput-topics6.gz --optimize-interval 10 --optimize-burn-in 20 --output-doc-topics filterTopics-topics6.txt --output-topic-keys filterKeys-topics6.txt 
```

7 topics
```
bin\mallet train-topics --input filter.mallet --num-topics 7 --output-state filterOutput-topics7.gz --optimize-interval 10 --optimize-burn-in 20 --output-doc-topics filterTopics-topics7.txt --output-topic-keys filterKeys-topics7.txt 
```
