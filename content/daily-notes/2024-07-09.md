#### Meeting with Simon and Marina

- Updates
	- Trying different anchoring strengths – in general, the unsupervised model does a terrible job of identifying things with good TC; tends to maximize the first topic at the expense of all others. 
- Things to discuss
	- CorEx is discriminative and gives the probability that a document belongs to a given topic. What are the implications of generative vs. discriminative clustering methods?
	- Besides subjective evaluation, what empirical measures to use to evaluate topics? Possibly aim for approximately even TC (rather than maximizing overall TC) so topics have similar validity in appearance?
		- Intuitively, makes sense that deduction/deductive words would be strongest if people are generally writing out proofs.
		- Usage of a “junk topic”?
	- Strongest topics: deduction, induction, examples, strategizing, impasse, expectations
	- Things to look at next: overall distribution of topics over time, distribution of topics for a given user, higher-level “dialogue patterns”
		- Side note, can see if follows Lakatos-style dialogical reasoning broadly
		- Finding overall distributions might be strange when there are threads working in parallel

#### Topic modeling

- Note that the bi-gram ratio is 20 for the “inclusion” list training
