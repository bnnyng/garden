# Notes

- Started a note for [[morning-pages]].
- Having a lot of trouble wanting to do anything at all; think I am going into withdrawals from the binge ‚Äúhigh.‚Äù I need to remember that doing nothing is more productive than relapsing right now. I can literally lie on the floor and stare at the ceiling, being bored out of my mind; that is still more productive than giving into the urges.

	- Could sit in for [Bayesian Statistics](https://myplan.uw.edu/course/#/courses/STAT%20544?id=4a6c425c-082e-482e-897e-70cfb1b26ad2&states=N4Ig7gDgziBcLADrgJYDsAmB7MAJApigOYAWALsrAJwAsATADTJjrZgAKWUKZKWalAMwBWAOwA6QVME0RABmEAOYbQC%2BIVUA) class?
	- Real analysis and algebra classes are too rudimentary to count for credit; look into computer science, applied math, statistics?
