	- Use techniques from “[Diversity of Argument-Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07938#:~:text=This%20reveals%20six%20distinct%20argument,and%20cause%2C%20and%20personal%20experience.)”
- Distinction between open-ended questions and questions known to be feasible! From Kleinberg/Kloumann paper (see [[2024-06-17]])
- “Iron law of peer production”
- How to operationalize significance? – upvotes vs. final paper argument
	- Maybe compare both?

The "iron law of oligarchy" states that all forms of organization, regardless of how democratic they may be at the start, will eventually and inevitably develop oligarchic tendencies, thus making true democracy practically and theoretically impossible, especially in large groups and complex organizations. The relative structural fluidity in a small-scale democracy succumbs to "social viscosity" in a large-scale organization. According to the "iron law", democracy and large-scale organization are incompatible.

I believe that the most interesting questions here are things like 1) what are the cognitive functions of these contributions, 2) how do these interact with each other, 3) whether individuals specialize on the functional role of their contributions (e.g., "I tend to mostly present counter-examples, while Bonnie's role is coming up with new ideas"), 4) how these cognitive features relate to the success of the final result, and so on:) I do believe that some of these analyses could be doable next steps (if we can scrape the data), and it seems like Simon has a similar intuition.
