#### Neural code final portfolio meeting

[[20241009-neural-code-final-portfolio-proposal|Neural Code final portfolio proposal]]

- Think about what different components should be
	- Starting point – existing model with a wrapper?
	- Small experiment?
	- Demonstrating idea or narrative
	- Demonstrate understanding of key concepts

#### Analysis notes

- Tuesday, Oct 8:
	- [ ] Sequence, subsequential limits?
	- [ ] Sequence escaping to infinity
	- [x] Limsup, liminf, examples
	- [x] Nth partial sum, series, converging and limit; examples
	- [ ] Geometric series converges and diverges
	- [ ] Cauchy criterion theorem
	- [ ] Sequence which has a convergent series has limit of series = 0
	- [ ] Converges absolutely
