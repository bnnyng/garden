# Notes

- I took my ADHD medication today about an hour *after* having any food and I feel exponentially better.
- Professors that could potentially mentor or recommend me, if I work on progressing the relationship:
	- John Morrison
	- George Dragomir
	- Brian Plancher
	- SFI faculty
	- Possibly Mike Miller, if I send a ‚Äúredemption‚Äù email about how I‚Äôve improved on my past flaws (i.e., accountability, ability to submit things on time)

[[2024-03-03]]

- Made a permanent note to store the [[application-2024-csuremm]], similar to [[application-2024-sfi-ucr]]
