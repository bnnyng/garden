>[!example] Reminder
>Be the most excellent version of myself I can be, one day at a time. If I look back on today specifically, I want to be proud of what I did and who I am.

# To do

> What are the top three *most important* things I need to do today?

- [x] Come up with topic assignments to discuss during meeting (see Slack)
- [x] Implement embedded topic model

> What other things can I do today that are less important?
## Today

- [ ] Clean documents according to specification in Dieng et al.

#### Dieng et al., 2019. “Topic Modeling in Embedding Spaces”

- Generative process of the ETM
	- Draw topic proportions from logistic-normal distribution (for ease of reparameterization by **inference algorithm**)
	- For each each word, draw a topic assignment from the categorical distribution associated with a variable $\theta_d$ for document $d$; then, draw the word from the topic distribution $\text{softmax}(\rho^\perp \alpha)$, where $\rho$ is the embedding matrix and $\alpha$ is the embedded topic vector
- Data preprocessing
	- **Corpus:** Filter stop words, words with document frequency > 70 percent, and tokenize (make every document string into a list)
	- **Vocabulary:** Vary minimum documents needed for word to appear, with highest minimum being 5 percent and lowest being two documents
	- Pre-fit with skip-gram embeddings

2	0.30169	question example condition case would find interesting problem think let true answer general counterexample following basis take prove possible also 
3	0.55763	would think will get could might something take see try say let whether find example should idea want look perhaps

0	0.38559	problem would also will could think approach may might perhaps try idea know work maybe useful problems help find use 
1	0.23404	let condition case prove true basis proof following simple statement find result consider show would conditions also possible follows counterexample 
2	0.41489	using also get could would results best found see method seems different possible will better result case give already work 
3	0.17563	must case most will thus assume proof implies suppose contradiction possible get also exactly cannot cases induction without either hence 
4	0.25335	question example whether answer interesting examples would problem know case find questions think could general might construction original yes see 
5	0.15889	proof argument think cant see get work use prove find completely sure anyone actually fact arguments need result got stuck 
6	0.34935	should using may also use get argument problem rather need case gives instead will better approximation thus actually seems fact 
7	0.5528	would think could might get something will should perhaps seems idea try work look almost know whether see thought find 
8	0.27973	will let get take think lets say try need want example suppose use different give see find pick consider gives 
9	0.32675	should think also right seems yes sorry something definition see missing after understand correct probably instead meant mean made actually
