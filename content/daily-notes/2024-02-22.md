# Notes

- Made a long list of papers to read in Semantic Scholar‚Äîcovering Bayesian models of conceptual development, and some developmental psychology.
	- Goal: get an understanding of current modeling applications, as well as results from behavioral studies that can be applied.
	- Future, not my current priority: more technical background!
- Papers and connections
	- [[Ullman, Tomer]], [[Tenenbaum, Josh]] ‚Äì [Bayesian Models of Conceptual Development: Learning as Building Models of the World](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/41b4/208497ea832b59a241708c3fe4b17973175d.pdf?_gl=1*1fny988*_ga*MTMxODU2MDc1LjE3MDg0MDAyNjI.*_ga_H7P4ZT52H5*MTcwODYzOTU0Ny42LjEuMTcwODYzOTcyNS4xNS4wLjA.)
		- Concept learning, Lake et al. 2015
		- Counterfactual reasoning, Gerstenberg & Tenenbaum 2017
		- Action understanding or intuitive psychology, Baker et al. 2017, Jara-Ettinger et al. 2016
		- Minimal nativism and core knowledge, Lake et al. 2017
		- Working computational models of core knowledge, Smith et al. 2019 & 2020
- Technical resources:
	- Probabilistic Models of Cognition textbook: https://probmods.org/
- Becoming kind of overwhelmed! Skimmed a lot about Bayesian models of cognitive development (and conceptual development), now onto theory of mind?
	- I also feel more guilty as my notes in here become messier; I have anxiety about them becoming redundant, yet am unwilling to restructure or refactor old notes. For example, I don‚Äôt know that the [[Probabilistic reasoning]] page is still useful or meaningful for me. 
	- I‚Äôm afraid I just have way too many notes on Bayes‚Äô theorem: [[Pragmatic Bayesian modeling]], [[Bayesian models of cognition|Bayesian model]], [[Conditional probability and Bayes' theorem]]

		- Update: doesn‚Äôt count because only 3 credits

	- Real analysis and algebra classes are too rudimentary to count for credit; look into computer science, applied math, statistics?
