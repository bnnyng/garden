>[!example] [[20240116-bb-program-week-3|Week 3: Feeling Your Feelings]]
>**Intention:** Allow feelings with love and curiosity. Feeling them and understanding them rather than blocking and resisting them
>
>**Goals and objectives:**
>1. Familiarize myself with my feelings (journal around them to raise awareness).
>2. Practice feeling my feelings 1x per day (step, observe, describe, breathe).

> Weekly goals:
> 1. Why are my weekly goals important me to *today*?
> 2. How do I need to show up *today* to achieve these goals? What action items will help me move towards my goals, and what intentional thoughts will help me get those items done?

**Goal 1**: Practice the pause method 3x per day, whether or not I feel the urge to binge.

**Goal 2:** Perform a deliberate night routine after I am done working for the day, before I do anything else to unwind.

**Goal 3:** Each day, I will do a bit of learning or work on something unrelated to CUMMW.
