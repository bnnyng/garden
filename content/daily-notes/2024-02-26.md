# Notes

- Da Vinci Resolve for video editing; probably need external hard drive for videos!
- Tomorrow I should:
	- Finish reading the paper I decided on, take some literature notes to help me parse. This will probably take me multiple hours, but I should aim to get it done before noon.
	- Draft the project proposal, then the personal statement to align with the proposal. I just need to get words on the page, can always polish later; I would prefer to have the two days to clean up my proposal.
	- Outside of this being my main priority, I still need to edit the math paper‚Äîdedicate Sunday to that at the latest.
- Finishing *Biography of X*
	- Later chapters felt redundant, there weren‚Äôt any more ‚Äúsecrets‚Äù being revealed; more a vehicle for mentioning various intellectual scenes in NYC through the middle and late 20th century. As such, it was thematically disjointed. The North/South alternative history split is truly only mentioned in the background later on as an abstract source of turmoil. 
	- Primary sources were modified and incorporated very naturally. Based on the point above, it was the prose that kept me going.
	- Things are opened and revealed too easily, more tell than show again‚Äîthough the prose is well crafted, many quotables.

		- Update: doesn‚Äôt count because only 3 credits
	- Could sit in for [Bayesian Statistics](https://myplan.uw.edu/course/#/courses/STAT%20544?id=4a6c425c-082e-482e-897e-70cfb1b26ad2&states=N4Ig7gDgziBcLADrgJYDsAmB7MAJApigOYAWALsrAJwAsATADTJjrZgAKWUKZKWalAMwBWAOwA6QVME0RABmEAOYbQC%2BIVUA) class?
	- Real analysis and algebra classes are too rudimentary to count for credit; look into computer science, applied math, statistics?
