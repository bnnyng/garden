# Notes

- Started a list of [[20240207-creature-comforts]]
- Cleaned out my YouTube “Watch Later” pretty thoroughly. All that is left now is:
	- Some art videos from long ago (not sure if I’ll ever get to those, still, but they are a part of who I want to be w.r.t. to creative pursuits)
	- Study vlogs; for some reason I’m wanting to keep these on the back burner for when I need study motivation, like during the “trenches” of Spring 2023. That won’t be for a while though?
	- Technical interviews and lectures about things I want to learn, which I always feel too much pressure to watch
- Drank two cups of tea around 11 and now I feel too stimulated!
