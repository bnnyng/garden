#### [[MATH-GU4061|Modern Analysis I]] content

- Definitions
	- Complex numbers
	- Metric space (five examples)
	- Vector space
	- Normed vector space
	- Inner product space
	- Open ball
	- Interior point
	- Open set
	- Closed set contains every limit point (boundary point is not a part of the set)
	- Limit point
- Propositions
	- Normed vector spaces are metric spaces
	- Inner product space $\implies$ normed vector space…
	- Set open if complement closed
