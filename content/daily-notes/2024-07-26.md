# Notes

#### Brain dump

- What to do about parallelism/reply chains?

#### Bigger picture

```
If I think about what a killer paper looks like, it might combine these two; one section is on the differential composition of successful vs unsuccessful groups, another is on the relationship between functional (semantic) role and cognitive move.
```

#### Computing auto-novelty vs. novelty with others

- Procedure
	- For a central comment $C$, get 10-comment windows before and after which contain both self-comments and comments by others (how “novel” I am conditioned on being an active participant)
		- Practical considerations: make this DataFrame first to select for the “possible” comments
	- Compute N/T for self comments $s_n$ and other comments $o_m$
	- Possibly scatterplot?
