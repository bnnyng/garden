>
>**Goals and objectives:**

> Themed journal question: 
- Think of your body or look at your body. What are all the unfiltered thoughts and feelings that come up?
- How do those thoughts and feelings influence your actions throughout the day?
- What do you want to think and feel towards your body & why?
- If you unconditionally love your body, how would you think and act towards it and its perceived flaws?
- How can you treat your body with love and respect on purpose regardless of its state?
