>Be the most excellent version of myself I can be, one day at a time. If I look back on today specifically, I want to be proud of what I did and who I am.

# To do

> What are the top three *most important* things I need to do today?

- [x] Measure novelty and transience for top Polymath contributors
- [x] Literature re-review to inspire more analysis

> What other things can I do today that are less important?
## Today

- [x] Get within-project distributions, organize data
- [ ] Read Gowers’ paper
## Future file

- [ ] Mark off comment highlights
- [x] Update Slack with thoughts on identifying cognitive moves, share Pease article
- [ ] Identify topics with strongest linear and arcing trends over a project

# Notes

#### Brain dump

- Main cognitive themes to tie in
	- Mathematical explanation: https://github.com/alisonpease/Explanation-Data
	- Probabilistic judgements
- Moves to set aside for now
	- Aesthetic judgements – simple, beautiful, elegant
- Difficult to do the cognitive moves because it leans too much into philosophy and contextual analysis, which I am not an expert in
- Analyzing topic graphs
	- Could focus on critical points which are shared across different modeling computations?
```
Let me make a suggestion—why not spend some time thinking about the bigger picture of (1) how people work together and (2) how mathematicians think. Both are part of this puzzle. And perhaps that slide from my UCR talk might also help — when are people “thinking out loud”, when are people sharing their mental models, when are they sharing intuitions or “data”, when are they making models of each other?
```


#### MALLET knob turning

- Currently “up in the air”
	- Comment length cut-offs

**All comment data – semantic**
```
bin\mallet import-file --input data\semantic-P6.tsv --output semantic-P6.mallet --keep-sequence 
```

10 topics
```
bin\mallet train-topics --input semantic-P6.mallet --num-topics 10 --output-state semanticOutput10-P6.gz --optimize-interval 10 --optimize-burn-in 20 --output-doc-topics semanticTopics10-P6.txt --output-topic-keys semanticKeys10-P6.txt 
```
