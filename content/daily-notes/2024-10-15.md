#### [[MATH-GU4061|Modern Analysis I]] content

- Definitions
	- Continuous function at a point â€“ note that we also have the same definition from topology
	- Uniformly continuous function â€“ EVT implies delta obtains a max and min, how?
	- Homeomorphism
- Theorems
	- Function is continuous if and only if preimages are open
	- Continuous functions preserve compactness (built off of Munkres theorem)
	- Extreme value theorem? + examples ([[(Theorem) Extreme value|extreme value theorem]])
		- - $f: \mathbb R \to \mathbb R$ given by $f(x) = x^2$ does not attain its maximum.
		- $(0, 1] \to \mathbb R$ doesnâ€™t either, but on the domain $[0, 1]$ it does
		- Consequence: can define uniform continuityâ€”why?
	- Continuous functions on compact sets are also uniformly continuous
	- f bijection, continous, on compact set is a homeomorphism
	- Continuous functions preserve conectedness

Claim: $X \to \mathbb R$ that sends $x \mapsto d(x, A)$ is continuousâ€”see [[Continuous functions|uniformly continuous]] in todayâ€™s analysis class!

>[!abstract] Lemma: Lebesgue number
>If $\mathcal C$ is an open cover of a [[Compactness|compact]] [[Metrics, metric spaces, and the metric topology|metric space]], then there exists $\delta > 0$ such that whenever $\text{diam}(A) < \delta$, we have $A \subseteq U$ entirely contained for some $U \in \mathcal C$.

*Proof from [[MATH-GU4051|Topology]]*.

It suffices to show this for all balls $B_\delta (x)$, since if $\text{diam}(A) < \delta$ then $A \in B_\delta(x)$, where $x \in A$ is any point. Note that $B_\delta(x) \subseteq U$ if and only if $d(x, X \backslash U) \geq \delta$. 

ðŸ”º *Exercise.* Show that we do have  $B_\delta(x) \subseteq U$ if and only if $d(x, X \backslash U) \geq \delta$. **This trick is central to this proof!**

Assume $X \notin \mathcal C$, since otherwise any $\delta > 0$ works. Since $X$ is compact, assume $U_1, \ldots, U_n \in \mathcal C$ is a finite subcover of $X$. Define $Z_i = X \backslash U_i$, and let $f_i : X \to \mathbb R$ be the map $x \mapsto d(x, Z_i)$ for each $1 \leq i \leq n$. Further, define $f:X \to \mathbb R$ be defined by
$$
f(x) = \max\{ f_i(x) \ | \ i = 1, \ldots, n\}.
$$

ðŸ”º *Exercise*. Show that the maximum of finitely many continuous functions is continuous. (Hint: use induction).

Our goal is to prove that for all $x \in X$, we have $f(x) > 0$. If we know this, then since $f$ continuous implies $f(X)$ is compact, there exists $\delta > 0$ such that for all $x \in X$, we have
$$
f(x) > \delta > 0.
$$
Then we may conclude that for all $x \in X$, there exists $i \in \{ 1, \ldots, n\}$ such that 
$$
f(x) = f_i(x) = d(x, X \backslash U_i) > \delta \iff B_\delta(x) \subseteq U_i.
$$
#wip because the infimum is also strictly greater than 0? why is $f(x)$ strictly greater? Note that in general strictly greater than 0 because X compact.

To prove that $f(x)$ is always positive, let $x \in X$ so that $x \in U_i$ for some $i$. Then there exists $\epsilon > 0$ such that 
$$
x \in B_\epsilon (x) \subseteq U_i \implies d(x, X \backslash U_i) \geq \epsilon.
$$
Since the distance is precisely how we defined $f_i(x)$, we conclude that $f_i(x)> 0$.
