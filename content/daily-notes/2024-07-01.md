#### [Clements (1984), “Terence Tao”](https://gwern.net/doc/iq/high/smpy/1984-clements.pdf)

- **Analytic vs. visual methods:** “I was beginning to form the impression that Terence preferred to use analytic, non-visual methods in preference to making extensive use of visual imagery.”
	- Hence high level of activity online/blogging?
	- Preference for analytic problem-solving actually leads to better performance on spatial tests (Burden and Coulson, 1981)
- “The following characteristics stand out”
	- Strong long-term memory for definitions, proofs, and ideas;
	- Unconscious preference for verbal-logical and not visual thinking;
	- Ability to grasp abstractions without concrete examples;
	- Ability to learn from books and exercises without human instruction (how does this relate to collaborative ability?)
