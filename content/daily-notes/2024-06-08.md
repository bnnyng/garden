Hello James,

  

Sorry about the longer email. I have a vague project idea but not enough mathematical background to know whether it is feasible or how I might approach it, so Chris suggested I reach out to you.

  

Essentially, I would like to combine the SMS model of scientific reasoning [Wolpert & Kinney's paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10701-024-00755-9) (also attached) with models of scientific social interaction. I know agent-based modeling, like [Marina's work](https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv/ysv2u), is often used for this. Because she is also mentoring, I thought it would be relevant to incorporate the same "essential aspects of scientific activity" as her model: collecting data, building explanations, and learning from others (including data sharing, explanation sharing with different degrees of skepticism, teaching and learning). Here are some very preliminary considerations that I am stuck on:

- Theories/explanations in Marina's model are represented by neural autoencoders. Is there a straightforward way to implement the SMS model to replace the neural nets?
- If not an ABM, how else might social interaction be added to the SMS framework? Maybe starting with simpler interactions like agreement/disagreement?
- Instead of taking in data by sampling from some ground truth (interpretation of Marina's model), the scientist-SMS generates "cognitive events" (observations, memories?) of physical phenomena as a basis for theories. What is the functional difference between these, and would they be compatible in some kind of combined model?

If you're available, could we meet sometime early next week to talk through what can be done here? I would appreciate hearing any initial thoughts via email as well!

  

Best,

Bonnie

Hello Marina,

  

I hope the embassy things are going smoothly (I know the expectations are not high), and you are able to at least enjoy some of your weekend! As I mentioned, I have two different directions for project ideas that I wanted to briefly run by you. I don't think either of them are directly within your area of expertise, so I would be interested in your thoughts on how relevant your work might be to these potential projects, as well as if you have ideas for who else I can reach out to (Chris Kempner already suggested I meet with James early next week).

  

One potential goal, which I do not have a well-formed research question for, is to extend the paper ["Stochastic Models of Math and Science"](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10701-024-00755-9) (Wolpert & Kinney 2023, also attached to this email) to include social interaction in a scientific community. In short, I am wondering if it is possible to formalize "epistemic activity" from your "Against experimentation" paper using the stochastic model instead of an autoencoder neural net with weight updates. 

  

I am still familiarizing myself with the paper, but I will attempt to sketch the stochastic model: here, both settled and unsettled phenomena are represented as question-answer pairs. Agents and the "physical universe" are represented as stochastic systems; specifically, an agent is a system that generates outcomes of physical experiments, while the true universe is another system that is used to evaluate the agent's outcomes. Further, the agents are themselves a set of question-answer pairs to "embed" scientists into their physical universe. New epistemic positions are represented as the distribution of possible answers conditioned on the relevant questions and a set of established "ground truth" pairs.

  

Ideally, the stochastic + social model would implement at least one of the social learning strategies from your paper. I currently lack the background with respect to both papers to know if marrying the two is even feasible. One thing that stands out to me is that what is represented by the models might not be directly compatible.   

  

The other project would be creating proof network models to compare changes in proofs for a single theorem over time -- from initial publication by one individual to a refined version accepted by a community, such as those appearing in textbooks -- using essentially the same methods from the DiDeo paper you sent me. This would involve choosing several theorems where this sort of data is available, then hand-encoding the proof steps as network nodes. The goal would be to compare patterns in reasoning between individuals and collectives. I believe this is somewhat unrelated to what you are doing, so I am more wondering if there are any mathematics/networks/social reasoning people that would be more appropriate guides for this project.

  

Sorry about the long email! I am happy to discuss this in person early next week as well, especially as I get a clearer idea of what is going on in the stochastic model.

  

Best,

Bonnie

Hello Chris,

  

I hope your weekend is going well! Apologies for an email that would probably be more efficiently communicated in person.

  

I have a project idea to use as back-up in case extending Wolpert & Kinney's stochastic model of science to include social dynamics is too ambitious (I have not yet met with James, but currently I strongly suspect it might be). I would like to use the proof network modeling strategy from [Viteri & Dedeo (2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027722001081?dgcid=api_sd_search-api-endpoint) to model the evolution of proofs for a single theorem, from initial formulation by an individual to the refined community consensus that one might find in a textbook. I imagine this would entail selecting theorems with the necessary data and hand-encoding the different claims as network nodes, as the original authors do. 

  

Do you have any suggestions for math/network/reasoning people to run this idea by?

  

Best,

Bonnie
