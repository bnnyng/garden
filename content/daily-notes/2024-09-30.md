# Notes

#### Social Neuroscience test prep

- Key concepts
	- General
		- Models
	- Intro
		- Different brain regions – RTPJ, ACC, insula
		- Domain-specific and domain-general views for individual brain regions
		- Neural mechanisms – mirror neurons 
	- Methods
	- Emotion and motivation
		- Emotion and components of emotion
		- Models of emotion
		- Amygdala and other brain regions – and HOW
		- Dopamine for motivation
	- Understanding others
		- Brain regions – RTPJ, MPFC, temporal lobes, 
- Know studies by name! (Whichever ones have a lot of slides dedicated)
	- Brain methods
		- Freeman (2018) – Computer mouse tracking
	- Understanding others
		- Meyer (2012) – both TOM and emotion/motivation
- Essay questions are all about the studies
	- E.g., what are three studies that show the same result with different techniques
