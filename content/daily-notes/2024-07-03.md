-  Eavesdropping
	- `Will Fordenheim, MIT Media Lab; Wendy from Princeton who does art`
	- “The Beauty of Gaming”

#### Forming final word list

- Current strategy
	- Get top 200 words, remove a subset by inspection
	- Get all words shared across 70 percent or more of Polymaths (also 12/16), then examine the ones between 10 and 14 shared to include semantically interesting words
	- Get all words shared across 50 percent of mini-Polymaths
	- Join the two word sets, then remove the words that are specific to mini-Polymaths from the union to make the final set of words to remove

#### Topic modeling with hyperparameter optimization

Importing data to be used by Mallet
```
bin\mallet import-file --input data\comments-mallet.tsv --output comments.mallet --keep-sequence 
```

Training topics – 5
```
bin\mallet train-topics --input comments.mallet --num-topics 5 --output-state commentsOutput5.gz --optimize-interval 10 --optimize-burn-in 20 --output-doc-topics commentsTopics5.txt --output-topic-keys commentsKeys20.txt 
```

```
Final LL: -7.69589
```

Training topics – 10
```
bin\mallet train-topics --input comments.mallet --num-topics 10 --output-state commentsOutput10.gz --optimize-interval 10 --optimize-burn-in 20 --output-doc-topics commentsTopics10.txt --output-topic-keys commentsKeys10.txt 
```

```
Final LL: ~7.81
```

Training topics – 7
```
bin\mallet train-topics --input comments.mallet --num-topics 7 --output-state commentsOutput7.gz --optimize-interval 10 --optimize-burn-in 20 --output-doc-topics commentsTopics7.txt --output-topic-keys commentsKeys7.txt 
```

```
Final LL: ~7.75
```

#### Topic inspection

- 10 topics
	- Generally seems to separate into problems
	- Topic 2 is entirely about writing the paper
	- Topic 6 is entirely meta-discussion on how to move the threads around
- 5 topics
	- Topic 4 is meta discussion
	- Topic 5 is acknowledging uncertainty or error
