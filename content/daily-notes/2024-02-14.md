# Daily journal

>[!example] Weekly goals
>1. Why are my weekly goals important me to *today*?
>2. How do I need to show up *today* to achieve these goals? What action items will help me move towards my goals?
>3. What intentional thoughts will help me get those items done?

>**Goal 1:** Commit to abstinence from purging.

1. Yesterday I was perhaps in the depths of my depression, so much so that I had no will to even binge and purge. I felt all the emotions I have been trying to numb out with food: guilt, shame, inadequacy. I lived. And lo and behold, those feelings are slightly relieved today because I didn’t relapse. 
2. I need to be honest with myself about my hunger and whether I am eating for stimulation. I will find enjoyment in things that are not food and allow myself breaks that are not related to meals so that eating doesn’t become a relative “high.” I will remove myself from any situation that is exacerbating my urges. I will take regular breaks and plan my transitions between tasks.
3. Even if I don’t want the pleasure of eating to end, I know that is a fact of life. Purging will not be an option for me, even if I binge (and likely I won’t want to binge if I cannot purge). I had extremely strong urges in bed last night, and I survived—and am much happier for it. Every urge will pass. I need to recover so that I have something to show for my entire year off!
	1. Why does journaling about my eating disorder always trigger an urge? Ugh, perhaps I should be thankful for the opportunity to get more resilience and practice.

>**Goal 2:** Reach out to someone each day, whether over text or in person.

1. I felt a slight urge come up after eating breakfast and realizing I had a whole day stretched ahead of me—that kind of time is so daunting—and no prospects of people to be accountable to. It felt as if I might as well binge and purge since I don’t need to show up for anything. Thus, I need to create a life and purpose outside of bulimia.
2. I can text Rex and also go to this reading Meetup group in the evening.
3. I don’t have to commit to plans I make, if it triggers an urge for me. It is still better to do nothing at all than to purge.

>**Goal 3:** Check in with the recovery group each day.

1. I paid good money to be in this group! Plus, these are the only people who are going through the same struggles as me. They have given so much to me by being vulnerable; I want to feel a part of that as well, I want to give back.
2. Just check the messages, at bare minimum.
3. Everyone’s story is worth understanding and reading, without comparison or always thinking about my own.

# Notes

- Could not decide on what to read this morning, which made me not want to start my day! There seems to be too much time, and yet it flies by. 
- Summer outlook
	- Taking courses at Barnard/Columbia is not an option; evidently financial aid is not offered. 
		- However, might be able to take courses at UW and transfer credits (maximum 9 per semester and 8 in the summer)!
		- I should make a list of courses to take at UW and reach out to [advisors and Registrar](https://barnard.edu/student-leaves-absence/faq) about spring term ASAP—need to ensure that courses will both be transferred and count as credit.
	- I am eligible for participation in [mathematical modeling summer research](https://www.math.columbia.edu/programs-math/undergraduate-program/undergraduate-research/csuremm/)—need to start doing research on project proposals!
- UW possible spring semester courses
	- [Introduction to Differential Equations](https://myplan.uw.edu/course/#/courses/MATH%20207?states=N4Ig7gDgziBcLADrgJYDsAmB7MAJApigOYAWALsrAEwAMA7AMwA0yY62YACllCmSljSVaAVgB0DSQyoAOKgBY69GgwC%2BIVUA) – c.f. [Ordinary Differential Equations](https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/#subj/MATH/V2030-20241-001/)
		- [UW course syllabus](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~aloveles/Math207Materials/syllabus.pdf) vs. [Columbia course syllabus](https://math.columbia.edu/~samdehority/files/2021-summer-ODEs/syllabus.pdf)– both use the Boyce, et al. text
- Rabbit hole: [NeurIPS Intrinsically Motivated Open-ended Learning Workshop](https://nips.cc/virtual/2023/workshop/66534)
- Email to Gureckis
	- Explain motivation – grad school goals, want to understand research techniques before committing (seems sympathetic to this, based on website)
		- Background – mathematics and cognitive science; research experience
		- Interests – computational models of intrinsic motivation
		- What I hope to achieve
- Starting some literature notes
	- [[1946-sartre-existentialism-is-a-humanism]]
