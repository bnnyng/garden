# Notes

- Potential extensions to the Learned Inference model:
	- Changing model framework to incorporate **subadditivity**

[[2024-02-26]]

- Tomorrow I should:
	- Finish reading the paper I decided on, take some literature notes to help me parse. This will probably take me multiple hours, but I should aim to get it done before noon.
	- Draft the project proposal, then the personal statement to align with the proposal. I just need to get words on the page, can always polish later; I would prefer to have the two days to clean up my proposal.
	- Outside of this being my main priority, I still need to edit the math paper‚Äîdedicate Sunday to that at the latest.

		- Update: doesn‚Äôt count because only 3 credits
	- Could sit in for [Bayesian Statistics](https://myplan.uw.edu/course/#/courses/STAT%20544?id=4a6c425c-082e-482e-897e-70cfb1b26ad2&states=N4Ig7gDgziBcLADrgJYDsAmB7MAJApigOYAWALsrAJwAsATADTJjrZgAKWUKZKWalAMwBWAOwA6QVME0RABmEAOYbQC%2BIVUA) class?
	- Real analysis and algebra classes are too rudimentary to count for credit; look into computer science, applied math, statistics?
