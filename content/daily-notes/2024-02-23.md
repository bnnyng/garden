# Notes

- Possible research directions:
	- Theory of mind ‚Äì richer perceptual data, like used with babies? What variations to try and model?
	- Joint physical and social reasoning
		- Using physics for both baseline and cost functions
		- Effort related to force or distance ‚Äì Liu, Ullman, Tenenbaum, Spelke 2017
		- Sosa, Ullman, Tenenbaum, Gershman, & Gerstenberg 2021
- Data source: The Moral Machine Experiment!

		- Recent work has found initial evidence that inferences about types of minds can be expressed as Bayesian inference of a space of planning and decision-models of varying complexity (Burger & Jara-Ettinger, 2020). More research is needed in characterizing the variability in the different types of minds that we can represent, and formalizing this space to explain how people can jointly infer another agent‚Äôs type of mind as well as their mental states.

# Media log

Mrs. Dalloway | Virginia Woolf | Book
- Some preliminary thoughts before I write a full review!
- Compared with existentialism I‚Äôve been reading; while existentialism‚Äôs entire premise that people are nothing outside of their actions, Woolf‚Äôs story, which is nothing but the interiority of various figures, is almost the direct opposite. 
- Eagleton on Woolf ([[How to Read Literature]] 65, 67, 69, 110, 191; Mrs. Dalloway on 64):
	- [[2013-eagleton-how-to-read-literature]]
	- ‚ÄúModernist novel‚Ä¶single, solitary consciousness.‚Äù
	- ‚ÄúConcept of identity is in crisis.‚Äù Realism depicts people as continuous, part of a ‚Äúcoherent evolution,‚Äù people as the agents of their own identities (but isn‚Äôt this what existentialism circles back to?)
	- Character ‚Äúdisintegrates,‚Äù character is consciousness itself; ‚Äúhaving too little identity can be quite as disabling as having too much.‚Äù
	- ‚ÄúThe true protagonist is not this or that character, but language itself.‚Äù
	- *Not* ‚Äúcredible, fully-rounded individuals‚Äù lol.
