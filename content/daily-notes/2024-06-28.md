# Notes

- Connection by Will Tracy to two post-docs at Princeton associated with Simon Levin?
	- Science of science, tracking who speaks in meetings and for what time, how that impacts outcomes
	- Looking at behavior and dominance on r/place (casually just friends with the founder of Reddit, hence availability of data)
	- Kind of overwhelmed by the number of connections!

```

```
