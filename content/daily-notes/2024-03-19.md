# Notes

- Notes on writing a senior thesis/getting research experience
	- Should find thesis advisor before fall of senior year; will spend approximately the year writing. Ideally, have a relationship with the professor beforehand, but not necessary.
	- Advisors are not restricted to Barnard/Columbia
	- Research can count as an elective towards the major requirements (limitations?)
	- Potential mentors: Kriegsorte, Lila Davachi, Wei Ji Ma (mentored in the past, Hannah?)

	- What is the process of choosing a senior advisor?
	- Should student have pre-existing relationship with advisor (i.e., already works in a lab)?
	- Does the advisor have to be a Columbia affiliate, based in NYC, etc.?
	- Any connections to people doing computational cognitive science in the city?
