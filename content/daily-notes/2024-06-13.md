# Notes

#### Polymath project general

- Citations of Redner – power-law exponent
	- Network growth by copying - [10.1103/PhysRevE.71.036118](https://doi.org/10.1103/physreve.71.036118)
	- Connectivity of growing random networks - [10.1103/PhysRevLett.85.4629](https://doi.org/10.1103/physrevlett.85.4629)

#### Plotting degree distributions
- Note that each citation was counted, even within a single proof – some justification for doing this, but willing to do it again
