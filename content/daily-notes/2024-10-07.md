# Notes

#### Topology midterm review

See: [[How to Study for Math]]

- [ ] Make “mind map”/flowchart of concepts, definitions, and key results
- [ ] Make a sheet of definitions and relationships with EXAMPLES
- [ ] Go through proofs from class/textbook, make note of the essential argument for each
	- [ ] Product $\subset$ uniform $\subset$ box topology
	- [ ] Product/uniform/box topologies are the same for a finite set, different if infinite
	- [ ] Topology induced by Euclidean metric is the same as the product topology on $\mathbb R^n$
	- [ ] Metric that induces a topology on $\mathbb R^\omega$
- [ ] Go through HW5 problems on connectedness
- [ ] Go through recommended problems from Munkres
- [ ] Review homework problems
	- [ ] Different set equalities with closure/interior
