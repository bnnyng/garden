- Approaches
	- Contexualized topic model – try simply “cleaned” dataset
	- LDA with [“junk topics”](https://mimno.infosci.cornell.edu/info6150/readings/ECML09_AlSumaitetal.pdf)
	- Hierarchical topic models after removing junk topics?
- Vocabulary refinement
	- TF-IDF to do automatically
- Model selection
	- LDA: 1,000 – 10,000 words
	- BERTopic and CTM: 5,000 – 50,000 words
	- CorEx: 2,000 – 20,000 words
