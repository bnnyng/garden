>Be the most excellent version of myself I can be, one day at a time. If I look back on today specifically, I want to be proud of what I did and who I am.

# To do

> What are the top three *most important* things I need to do today?

- [x] Clean data sets for semantic topic modeling and try basic MALLET model
- [ ] Read most relevant papers for embedding strategies
- [ ] Analyze inclusion topic model and come up with topic names

## Today

- [ ] Look into Robbie Ward’s suggestions
	- [ ] Danny Bassett book on curiosity
	- [ ] [Peter Dodd’s research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xK3kOxQAAAAJ&hl=en)
	- [ ] Rhetorical function studies
- [ ] Update Slack with KL attempts

## Future file

- [ ] Encode reply threads where each comment is a “node”

# Notes

#### Topic modeling of intra-project semantics – v1

- Issues with initial word cleaning – mathematics-related terms are not very well filtered
	- Existing corpora of math subfields to use?
	- Incorporate LaTeX equations somehow
	- What about comments that, by inspection, are not really about math topics at all? Remove based on distribution?

**Project 2**

```
bin\mallet import-file --input data\comments-semantic-P2.tsv --output semantic-P2.mallet --keep-sequence 
```

```
bin\mallet train-topics --input semantic-P2.mallet --num-topics 10 --output-state semanticOutput-P2-topics10.gz --optimize-interval 10 --optimize-burn-in 20 --output-doc-topics semanticTopics-P2-topics10.txt --output-topic-keys semanticKeys-P2-topics10.txt 
```

#### Getting KL divergence

- What is the “null model”?
```
# Null model
null_permutation = np.random.permutation(topic_array.shape[0])
null_array = topic_array[null_permutation]
null_matrix = get_kl_doc2doc(null_array)
null_list = get_kl_list(null_matrix)
```
