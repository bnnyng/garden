>Be the most excellent version of myself I can be, one day at a time. If I look back on today specifically, I want to be proud of what I did and who I am.

# To do

> What are the top three *most important* things I need to do today?

- [ ] Finish a *presentable* version of final talk slides
- [ ] Start rehearsing final talk – run through a full version!

> What other things can I do today that are less important?
## Today

- Slide materials ([[20240724-sfi-final-talk-brain-dump]])
	- [x] Dendrogram of hierarchy
- Slide assembly
	- [ ] Gather relevant background notes
- Slide details
	- [ ] More decomposition of a cognitive comment example?

## Future file

- [ ] Send Pedro (postdoc) chapter from *Where Mathematics Comes From* on why math doesn’t exist outside the human mind

[[2024-08-02]]

- [ ] Reach out to Raphael Milliere
- [ ] Re-run analyses for cognitive topics
- [ ] Compute novelty and transience of key comments vs. “system average”, non-key comments
- [ ] Look into Robb Rutledge in advance of visit

# Notes

#### Talk themes

- What it means to “practice” math or science as an activity
- “How do people work together to solve a problem? How do mathematicians think?”

#### Talk background

- Diversity
	- Page (2004): Functional diversity is “differences in how people represent problems and how they go about solving them”; in contrast to identity diversity.
		- 
- Theories (cognitive mechanisms) of mathematical discovery
	- Limitations: individualistic and isolated (“individual genius”); limited in scope and types of mathematics (non-Western mathematics?) – grand discussions of whether mathematics is “real”
	- Self-report narratives are not reliable either…
- Collaborative nature of science
- Collective problem-solving
	- Empirical studies on how people work together, agent-based models
	- “Groups of diverse problem-solvers outperform groups of high-ability problem solvers”
