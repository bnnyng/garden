# Notes

- People I feel like I can ask for a letter of rec for something:
	- Dr. Grace Lindsay – CURP mentor, knows my research abilities best
	- Mike – knows my writing abilities best, but probably a poor impression due to health problems and erratic behavior over the semester
- Tried to make a speculative schedule for a physics major in the last two years of college, don’t think it’s possible given the three-semester timeline (unless substituting in classes taken at other schools). No way to overlap the intro sequence
- Past UCR projects that are interesting to me ([[20231221-application-santa-fe-institute-undergraduate-research#[Past projects](https //www.santafe.edu/engage/learn/projects)]])
	- Abstract conceptual reasoning? Someone did 1D spatial reasoning…reminds me of the paper 
		- “Learning intuitive physics”
		- “Learning neural representations for efficient learning”
	- Multitasking?
