# Notes

#### Topology notes

- Instructive proofs/examples to review
	- [x] Every interval is connected
	- [ ] Topologist’s sine curve; proof that the closure is what it is claimed in notes – go back to 10/3 paper notes
	- [ ] 10/1 notes – $\mathbb R^n$ and $\mathbb R$ are not homeomorphic
- Questions in general
	- Why does Hausdorff imply singletons are closed?
	- 10/10 Why are countably infinite products of compact spaces compact in product topology, but not box?
	- Why is proving continuity of inverse $f^{-1}$ the same as proving images of open/closed sets under $f$ are also open/closed?
	- Diff between separation and “neither contains a limit point of the other”?

#### Topology homework 

- (4) Sketch of ideas:
	- (a) Show that any two points of X are either on the same line segment, which is the image of a path, so path-connected; or on two different line segments, which is the image of a “pasted” path, so path-connected
		- Upshot: images of paths are path-connected—can just state because obviously true? Or rigorously show domain works out, like in class?
	- (a) For $\overline X$, show that the limit points are the image of the path from 0 to 1
	- (b) For Y connected, show that sequence in X converges to (0, 1), so (0, 1) must be in the same connected component as X
	- (b) For Y not path-connected….? Seems obvious?
- (5a) What am I trying to show? “Well-defined” means that every component of X has image contained in a unique component in Y? Same for path component?
- (5) In general, how to even show that these things are not homeomorphic?
