# Notes

#### [[MATH-GU4061|Modern Analysis I]] midterm review

- To do
	- [ ] Know proofs for circled theorems
	- [ ] Know proof of [[(Theorem) Heine-Borel|Heine-Borel]]
	- [ ] Proof of limit point compact implies sequentially compact
- Set theory
	- Countable, uncountable, finite sets
	- Operations
- Real/complex numbers
	- Max is not the same supremumâ€”doesnâ€™t always exist, but supremum does (similar for [[Bounded sets and functions|limit superior]]) ðŸ”º
	- Addition and multiplication on R
	- $z/w = (z\overline w)/|w|^2)$ where $|w|^2 = w \overline w$
- Questions
	- Lim sup meaning, why can we talk about it, when does limit not exist so that lim sup is required
	- When does Cauchy imply convergence? In complete m. spaces?

#### [[MATH-GU4051|Topology]] lecture notes

- Definitions
	- LPC, sequentially compact
	- [[Local compactness and compactification]]
		- Note: compact implies locally compact
	- Stereographic projection
- Theorems
	- Compact implies LPC in any space; all three are equivalent in metric space
		- ðŸ”º Read SC â†’ compact in Munkres 28
	- Stereographic projection function is a homeomorphism (check w/ explicit inverse) 
- Make separate notes for compactness, limit point and sequential compactness, and tx. functions on compact spaces?
	- Stereographic projections
- Review questions
	- Is [[The countably infinite product of the real line with itself]] locally compact? Box topology?

$fS^1\backslash \{ N\} \to \mathbb R$ has $f(x_1, x_2) = \frac{x_1}{1 - x_2}$.

- What spaces can we do this for? remove a point, make a new space where the complement of the single point is just the original space
	- Y Hausdorffâ€¦
