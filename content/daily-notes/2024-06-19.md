# Notes

#### Webscraping
- Next steps
	- Complete scraping for Polymath1 – create pipeline for scraping Tao’s blog
	- Strategy for parsing comments

#### Polymath comment data

- Idea from ?? CS: vectorizing each comment – what can we do?
- References / replies are represented by keywords
	- “Re” or “Response to”
	- Name of previous poster
	- Index / number of comment
- Idea from Sarah Walker: compare how much of the collective reasoning is “memory” (references to external sources, existing theorems, old comments) and how much is truly novel
	- Difficult to say because math is deductive, how to distinguish?
	- A new application can be considered novel?
- Notice that not all have upvotes and downvotes!
