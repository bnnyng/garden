>[!example] Week 2: Identifying and Changing Patterns
>**Intentions:**
>- Discover what worked from new routines, as well as what challenges came from them.
>- Learn more about what eating routines work, gain more awareness around my habits, and continue making progress away from behaviors.
>
>**Goals and objectives:**
>1. Review my biggest challenge with interrupting my behavior pattern and readjust based on what worked and didn’t work.
>2. Make any adjustments needed to eating patterns.

> Weekly goals:
> 1. Why are my weekly goals important me to *today*?
> 2. How do I need to show up *today* to achieve these goals? What action items will help me move towards my goals, and what intentional thoughts will help me get those items done?

**Goal 1:** Use the pause method every time I get an urge, reminding myself that relapsing is a choice.

**Goal 2:** Spend a majority of evenings without relapsing.

**Goal 3:** Wake up at 9 a.m. at the latest each day.


> Themed journal question: 

- What are points you can pause during this pattern?
- How is eating consistently and eating enough helping you, and is there anything you need to adjust in your eating pattern?
- What thoughts and feelings encourage you to binge and purge?
- How do you want to intentionally think and act when urges come up, regardless of your initial reaction?
- If urges were a separate person, how would you speak to them?

# Media log

The Visionaries | Wolfram Eilenberger | Book
- Currently about 100 pages in.
- Not sure the nonfiction format is a good use of my time, or the vignettes from their lives.
- Still, useful to put these ideas in context – probably would be getting more out of this if I were familiar with the ideas in the first place.
- Excited to chart their intellectual developments!

Break.up | Joanna Walsh | Book
- DNF at about 40 pages in, found the writing insufferable. Pseudo-philosophical babbling. To do philosophy is to let it imbue your existence; this reads like offhand, fake-deep ramblings about the world.
- Attempt at reading contemporary fiction.
- “Essay as novel” is also a difficult genre, really rides on the strength of ideas; Walsh’s just weren’t engaging or original.
- Maybe would have been more captivating if I had actually experienced a digital love.
