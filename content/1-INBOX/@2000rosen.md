# Summary

In this brief note, Rosen identifies [[Complex systems have nontrivial emergent and self-organizing behaviors|complex systems]] as those which do not have computable and formalizable models: “no list, no algorithm, no decision procedure” exists to give a full account. He argues that organisms are

- “Any question becomes unanswerable if we do not permit ourselves a universe large enough to deal with the question.”
- “I claim that the Godelian noncomputability results are a symptom, arising within mathematics itself, indicating that we are trying to solve problems in too limited a universe of discourse.”
- “I take seriously the possibility that there is no list, no algorithm, no decision procedure, that finds us the organisms in a presumptively larger universe of inorganic systems.”
- **The implications of Godel’s incompleteness theorem:** “Briefly, these results mean that a constructive universe, finitely generated, consisting of pure syntax, is too poor to do mathematics in. They mean that semantics and impredicativities and meanings are essential to mathematics; they cannot be replaced by more syntactic rules and more lists or algorithms. They mean that mathematical systems are generically unformalizable; hence it is the formalizable ones that are the rare special cases, and not the other way around. *They mean that identifying rigor with formalizability makes most of mathematics unreachable*.”
- **Organisms are more generic, complex, and unformalizable than inorganic systems:** “Rather than an organism being just a standard material system plus a list of special conditions, an organism is a repository of meanings andimpredicativities; it is more generic than an inorganic system rather than less. … If this is so, then organisms possess noncomputable, unformalizable models. *Such systems are what I call complex*.”
