## Kinds of writers

>[!quote]
>There are, first of all, two kinds of authors: those who write for the subject’s sake, and those who write for writing’s sake. … It is only the man who writes absolutely for the sake of the subject that writes anything worth writing.

- Schopenhauer claims that writing purely for writings’ sake is deceiving the reader.
	- There is an implicit assumption that writing should send informational content to others; deception, which includes falsehoods, has to do with a lack of utility?
- There are three kinds of writers: those who write from memory or reference to others, “without thinking”; those who “think in order to write”; and those who “have thought before they begin to write.”
	- The third kind is the one that Schopenhauer considers the rarest and most valuable.

## Modernity and progress

>[!quote]
>No greater mistake can be made than to imagine that what has been written latest is always the more correct; that what is written later on is an improvement on what was written previously; and that every change means progress.

- [[Scientific progress is often retrogressive, after Schopenhauer]]

>[!quote]
>What is new is seldom good, because a good thing is only new for a short time.
