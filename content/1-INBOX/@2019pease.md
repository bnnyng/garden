# Summary

> [!Abstract]
>Analysis of online mathematics forums can help reveal how explanation is used by mathematicians; we contend that this use of explanation may help to provide an informal conceptualization of simplicity. We extracted six conjectures from recent philosophical work on the occurrence and characteristics of explanation in mathematics. We then tested these conjectures against a corpus derived from online mathematical discussions. To this end, we employed two techniques, one based on indicator terms, the other on a random sample of comments lacking such indicators. Our findings suggest that explanation is widespread in mathematical practice and that it occurs not only in proofs but also in other mathematical contexts. Our work also provides further evidence for the utility of empirical methods in addressing philosophical problems.

# Key terms

- **Trace explanation** = “execution trace, the sequence of inferences that led to the conclusion of reasoning”; the reasoning process.
- **Strategic explanation** = “place action in context by revealing problem-solving strategy of the system used to perform a task”; learning why specific actions are preferred.
- **Deep explanation** = “answer using the knowledge base of an individual; bases explanation in what the explainee fails to understand”; why the result is correct, based on what is already understood.
- **Purposive elements** = beliefs, goals, desires, and intentions in practical reasoning.
