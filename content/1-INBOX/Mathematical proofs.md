A **mathematical proof** is a unidirectional, [[Deduction vs. abduction|deductive]] argument from axioms to conclusion. A proof never explicitly advances an [[Abduction is going from a believed conclusion to requirements for the conclusion to be true, after Peirce|abductive]] argument in the opposite direction; rather, abduction in mathematical proofs is an active reasoning process used to evaluate and build confidence in the deductive argument.
