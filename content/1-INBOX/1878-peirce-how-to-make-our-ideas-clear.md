# Reconstruction

## I

Peirce begins by critiquing the definitions of clear ideas and distinct ideas used by logicians. A **clear idea**, as opposed to **obscure**, is one that is recognizable and unmistakable. A **distinct idea** is one that can be given a precise, abstract definition, where the definition’s **content** is entirely clear. Clearness does not imply full understanding, only familiarity, and so needs to be supplemented by distinctness.


- Define clear and distinct
- Criticism of logicians, Descartes, limitations of their definitions

## II

- Method of reaching clearness comes from irritation of doubt
- Doubt is too strong, usually hesitation
- Two sorts of consciousness
- Essence of belief is establishing a habit

The purpose of thought is to produce habits of action.

>What a thing means is simply what habits it involves. … What the habit is depends on *when* and *how* it causes us to act. … Thus, we come down to what is tangible and conceivably practical, as the root of every real distinction of thought, no matter how subtle it may be; and there is no distinction of meaning so fine as to consist in anything but a possible difference of practice.

>Our idea of anything *is* our idea of its sensible effects.
