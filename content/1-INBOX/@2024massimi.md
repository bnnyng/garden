# Selected concepts and passages

- **”Criterial hallmarks” of perspectival representation:**
- **Explicit non-commitment:** “A perspectival representation represents its subject as having some property (or properties) that precludes being committal in some other respect.”
	- “A representation is **explicitly noncommittal** with respect to a given property if its representing the having of one feature precludes its taking a stand on the having or lacking of another. … Because of these limitations, there cannot be a single, comprehensive perspectival representation that represents everything from a single point of view.” [^1]
