*By Jean-Paul Sartre* – [Article link](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/sartre/works/exist/sartre.htm)– [[RAW-20240214-existentialism-is-a-humanism|Highlights]]
# Summary

In this lecture, Sartre gives his most famous formulation of existentialism: “existence comes before essence.”

---
# Key terms

- **Subjectivity** = the “first principle of existentialism”; the belief that there is no human nature or definition of mankind that is not preceded by plain existence.
- **Anguish** = man’s anxiety brought about by a “sense of complete and profound responsibility,” since every choice is both for oneself and all of mankind; c.f. Kierkegaard’s “anguish of Abraham.”
- **Abandonment** = the belief that God does not exist, leading to the logical conclusion that there is no “good” *a priori* and no ethical basis for our actions.
- **Despair** = limiting consideration to what is “within our wills, or within the sum of probabilities which render our action feasible”; follows from abandonment.

# Notes

## Charges against existentialism

- Sartre is responding to three opposing views which, broadly, charge existentialism with being a doctrine of the “evil side of human life”:
	- **Quietism** (Communists) – despair makes one inactive, which makes existentialism a contemplative, luxurious philosophy.
	- **Pessimism** (Christian) – “we forget how an infant smiles.”
	- **Subjectivism** (Communist, Christian) – because the doctrine is based on Cartesian *cogito*—”I think”—man is only considered in isolation and cannot be in solidarity with others.
	- **Voluntarism** (Christian; Platonist according to [this article](https://luchte.wordpress.com/jean-paul-sartres-existentialism-is-a-humanism-a-critical-reading/)) – existentialism ignores all “eternal” values, including the commandments of God, and is therefore without morality.
- Sartre responds to the ~3 charges with three definitions: anguish, abandonment, and despair.
	- “You have seen that it cannot be regarded as a philosophy of quietism since it defines man by his action; nor as a pessimistic description of man, for no doctrine is more optimistic, the destiny of man is placed within himself. Nor is it an attempt to discourage man from action since it tells him that there is no hope except in his action, and that the one thing which permits him to have life is the deed.”

## General characteristics of existentialism

- Existentialism is “intended strictly for technicians and philosophers.”
- People find the freedom of existentialism disturbing.
- Existentialism is the only theory which preserves the “dignity of man” by not treating man as an object.

## “Existence comes before essence”

- Sartre specifically takes an *atheist* position.

>[!quote]
>What do we mean by saying that existence precedes essence? We mean that man first of all exists, encounters himself, surges up in the world – and defines himself afterwards. … Thus, there is no human nature, because there is no God to have a conception of it. Man simply is.

>[!quote]
>The first effect of existentialism is that it puts every man in possession of himself as he is, and places the entire responsibility for his existence squarely upon his own shoulders.

- An individual is nothing but the sum of their actions; considering *potential* is only a way for miserable people to comfort themselves.
	- Thus, existentialism is not pessimism, but “stern optimism.”

>[!quote]
>\[Many sustain their misery by thinking,] “there remains within me a wide range of abilities, inclinations and potentialities, unused but perfectly viable, which endow me with a worthiness that could never be inferred from the mere history of my actions.” But in reality and for the existentialist, there is no love apart from the deeds of love; no potentiality of love other than that which is manifested in loving; there is no genius other than that which is expressed in works of art. The genius of Proust is the totality of the works of Proust.

### Anguish

- In being responsible for choosing one’s own existence, individual man is also responsible for “choosing for all mankind” …*why?*
	- In choosing actions that fulfill a particular image of man, the individual signifies which image is better, which “ought to be”; “for we are unable to ever choose the worse.”
		- #concept-question  *The last phrase is reminiscent of a Socratic argument! And what is our criterion for better/worse?*
	- Such responsibility leads to **anguish**.

### Abandonment

>[!quote]
>The existentialist, on the contrary, finds it extremely embarrassing that God does not exist, for there disappears with Him all possibility of finding values in an intelligible heaven. There can no longer be any good *a priori*, since there is no infinite and perfect consciousness to think it.

- Action comes before ethics; thus, different impulses to the same action are indistinguishable, rather than being sources of the action.
	- “A sentiment which is play-acting and one which is vital are two things that are hardly distinguishable one from another.”
	- “In other words, feeling is formed by the deeds that one does; therefore I cannot consult it as a guide to action. And that is to say that I can neither seek within myself for an authentic impulse to action, nor can I expect, from some ethic, formulae that will enable me to act.”
	- #concept-question *But what about the form that every action participates in, e.g., the notion of being a good son, a good soldier? Those roles exist before the taking of the action by an individual.*


>[!quote]
>To choose an advisor is nevertheless to commit oneself by that choice.

### Despair

>[!quote]
>When Descartes said, “Conquer yourself rather than the world,” what he meant was, at bottom, the same – that we should act without hope.
