# Summary

*By Ursula K. Le Guin* – [Source](https://stillmoving.org/resources/the-carrier-bag-theory-of-fiction)

Using Elizabeth Fisher’s Carrier Bag Theory of evolution—which claims that containers were a necessary survival technology that preceded weapons of domination—as a starting point, Le Guin grounds fiction in a more “human” alternative to stories of “Man the Hero.” According to Le Guin, the natural shape of narrative is a bag which may contain elements of conflict and harmony but ultimately has a purpose of “neither resolution nor stasis but continuing process.”

# Selected concepts and passages

- **Containers are the first cultural devices:** “The first cultural device was probably a recipient. … Many theorizers feel that the earliest cultural inventions must have been a container to hold gathered products and some kind of sling or net carrier.”
- **The Carrier Bag Theory of human evolution, after Elizabeth Fisher:** “Before—once you think about it, surely long before—the weapon, a late, luxurious, superfluous tool; long before the useful knife and ax; right along with the indispensable whacker, grinder, and digger—for what's the use of digging up a lot of potatoes if you have nothing to lug ones you can't eat home in—*with or before the tool that forces energy outward, we made the tool that brings energy home*.”
- **Dissociation from traditional narratives of the Ascent of Man:** “So long as culture was explained as originating from and elaborating upon the use of long, hard objects for sticking, bashing, and killing, I never thought that I had, or wanted, any particular share in it. (“*What Freud mistook for her lack of civilization is woman's lack of loyalty to civilization*,” Lillian Smith observed.)”

>Wanting to be human too, I sought for evidence that I was; but if that's what it took, to make a weapon and kill with it, then evidently I was either extremely defective as a human being, or not human at all.

- **Killer story, or story of Man the Hero, vs. life story:** “It is the story that makes the difference. *It is the story that hid my humanity from me*, the story the mammoth hunters told about bashing, thrusting, raping, killing, about the Hero. The wonderful, poisonous story of Botulism. The killer story. … The trouble is, we've all let ourselves become part of the killer story, and so we may get finished along with it. *Hence it is with a certain feeling of urgency that I seek the nature, subject, words of the other story, the untold one, the life story*.”

>The novel is a fundamentally unheroic kind of story.

- **Books as containers:** “A book holds words. Words hold things. They bear meanings. A novel is a medicine bundle, holding things in a particular, powerful relation to one another and to us.”

>This is why I like novels: instead of heroes they have people in them.
