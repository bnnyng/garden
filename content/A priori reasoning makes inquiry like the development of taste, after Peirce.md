>The \[[[Four methods of fixing belief, after Peirce|method of reasoning]] *a priori*] makes of inquiry something similar to the development of taste; but taste, unfortunately, is always more or less a matter of fashion. â€¦ We have examined into this *a priori* method as something which promised to deliver our opinions from their accidental and capricious element. But development, while it is a process which eliminates the effect of some causal circumstances, only magnifies that of others. [[@1877peirce]]
