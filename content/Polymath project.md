# Literature review

## Gowers & Nielson (2009) – “Massively Collaborative Mathematics”

- **Memory and collective intelligence:** “The blogs and wiki functioned as a collective short-term working memory, a conversational commons for the rapid-fire exchange and improvement of ideas.”
- **Numerical data:** “Over the next 37 days, 27 people contributed approximately 800 substantive comments, containing 170,000 words.”
- **Barriers to entry and lessons for scaling up:** “A significant barrier to entry was the linear narrative style of the blog. This made it difficult for late entrants to identify problems to which their talents could be applied. There was also a natural fear that they might have missed an earlier discussion and that any contribution they made would be redundant.”
