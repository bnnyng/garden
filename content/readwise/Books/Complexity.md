# Highlights
- [REDUCTIONISM is](private://read/01hjmjw71wrcxrs61d9nzdxv03#filepos759697) the most natural thing in the world to grasp. It’s simply the belief that “a whole can be understood completely if you understand its parts, and the nature of their ‘sum ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn1vxwqcey8er9ydzxwrc6q))
- Since the time of Descartes, Newton, and other founders of the modern scientific method until the beginning of the twentieth century, a chief goal of science has been a reductionist explanation of all phenomena in terms of fundamental physics ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn1x060s4h2atyh0hnea2ff))
    - Note: Axiomatic, formal system; predictable combination of rules.
- reductionist approach to cognition was misguided—we just couldn’t understand it at the level of individual neurons, synapses, and the like ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn20jbz95h29pz5w3k48vch))
    - Note: My own motivations and interest in complexity!
- Nigel Franks, a biologist specializing in ant behavior, has written, “[The solitary army ant](private://read/01hjmjw71wrcxrs61d9nzdxv03#filepos762500) is behaviorally one of the least sophisticated animals imaginable,” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn29s4zthze5ysydwgyt5w9))
- Such questions are the topics of *complex systems*, an interdisciplinary field of research that seeks to explain how large numbers of relatively simple entities organize themselves, without the benefit of any central controller, into a collective whole that creates patterns, uses information, and, in some cases, evolves and learns ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn2eradzg1x6qdgjm4p468b))
- The word *complex* comes from the Latin root *plectere*: to weave, entwine. In complex systems, many simple parts are irreducibly entwined, and the field of complexity is itself an entwining of many different fields ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn2dfq160pdxe0hteqsdrj2))
- an extended analogy between ant colonies and brains, both being complex systems in which relatively simple components with only limited communication among themselves collectively give rise to complicated and sophisticated system-wide (“global”) behavior. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn2jym2qz0c14rgbacgyps4))
- individuals (neurons or ants) perceive signals from other individuals, and a sufficient summed strength of these signals causes the individuals to act in certain ways that produce additional signals. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn2rrahpka8aj6w3wg10pqa))
- Economies are complex systems in which the “simple, microscopic” components consist of people (or companies) buying and selling goods, and the collective behavior is the complex, hard-to-predict behavior of markets as a whole, such as changes in the price of housing in different areas of the country or fluctuations in stock prices ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn2s90yhnatmwgng4r1zs72))
- In terms of profitability or consumer satisfaction, if someone is made better off, someone else will be made worse off. The process by which markets obtain this equilibrium is called *market efficiency*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn2trcmd1xg00d73marad4c))
- Adam Smith called this self-organizing behavior of markets the “invisible hand”: it arises from the myriad microscopic actions of individual buyers and seller ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn2v8j1cv5rz4ry4742en6e))
- More recently, economists involved in the field of complex systems have tried to explain market behavior in terms similar to those used previously in the descriptions of other complex systems ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn2wmjfr49cxe9zqy78e63p))
    - Note: Wonder if there are any useful applications in trading or investing?
- *complex system*: **a system in which large networks of components with no central control and simple rules of operation give rise to complex collective behavior, sophisticated information processing, and adaptation via learning or evolution.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn30gvbqqg5bbtx1e6s04t4))
- Systems in which organized behavior arises without an internal or external controller or leader are sometimes called *self-organizing* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn31c7cyyvbxw1h93asy47y))
- *complex system*: **a system that exhibits nontrivial emergent and self-organizing behaviors** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn31w5vc1kt97qk2d4jgnfn))
- dynamical systems are systems that change over time in some way ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn349kgwd0jb8kgjtq3037e))
- Mechanics is divided into two areas: kinematics, which describes how things move, and dynamics, which explains why things obey the laws of kinematics. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn3bcjj6bbh6erw5wyb8qfp))
- As he wrote: “[nature is exceedingly simple](private://read/01hjmjw71wrcxrs61d9nzdxv03#filepos763775) and conformable to herself. Whatever reasoning holds for greater motions, should hold for lesser ones as well.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn3ehhh9yfdf9p0kzccsz6m))
- given Newton’s laws and the current position and velocity of every particle in the universe, [it was possible, in principle, to predict everything for all time](private://read/01hjmjw71wrcxrs61d9nzdxv03#filepos764030) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn3fcztja1jcqdr2hbyra81))
    - Note: Laplace agrees with deterministic universe
- Werner Heisenberg’s 1927 “uncertainty principle” in quantum mechanics, which states that one cannot measure the exact values of the position and the momentum (mass times velocity) of a particle at the same time ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn3hegr6eahvxbjqgr6mer5))
- there are some systems—*chaotic* systems—in which even minuscule uncertainties in measurements of initial position and momentum can result in huge errors in long-term predictions of these quantities. This is known as “sensitive dependence on initial conditions.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn3j78cexjha83a6yfj8x6s))
- three-body problem: to determine, using Newton’s laws, the long-term motions of three masses exerting gravitational forces on one another. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn3mv4g53ypdn3v36mvmwp2))
- A linear system is one you can understand by understanding its parts individually and then putting them together ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn3rhwe9dy742qfapc7033r))
- A nonlinear system is one in which the whole is different from the sum of the parts ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn3rxfth39cc0pgxx2qatqh))
- This sense of the word *model* means a mathematical formula that describes population growth in a simplified way ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn3v2rsmyvr2kb38zcbn56p))
- This process of calculating the size of the next population again and again, starting each time with the immediately previous population, is called “iterating the model ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn3wx5k5d0dkerg06by0shn))
- The logistic population growth is not simply equal to the sum of its parts ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn3xpbrhc51cefm840zqhs1))
- Given this simplified model, scientists and mathematicians promptly forget all about population growth, carrying capacity, and anything else connected to the real world, and simply get lost in the astounding behavior of the equation itself. We will do the same. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn3znfxtj1mjyw13kqy60ng))
    - Note: On the simplified logistic model known as the logistic map, lol.
- In fact, it is one of the simplest systems to capture the essence of chaos: sensitive dependence on initial conditions ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn40w7kh15janjyp6ajfxr0))
    - Note: Ref logistic map
- This kind of regular final behavior (either fixed point or oscillation) is called an “attractor,” since, loosely speaking, any initial condition will eventually be “attracted to it.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn44rgbgdm5dk2vxbehaycc))
- Because it oscillates between two values, the system is said to have *period* equal to 2. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn45zq60a87pm19tfewk65q))
- At values of *R* that yield chaos, two trajectories starting from very similar values of *x*0, rather than converging to the same fixed point or oscillation, will instead progressively diverge from each other. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn486qxfgpyj7vjprp53x01))
- So far we have seen three different classes of final behavior (attractors): fixed-point, periodic, and chaotic. (Chaotic attractors are also sometimes called “strange attractors.”) *Type of attractor* is one way in which dynamical systems theory characterizes the behavior of a system ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn49n2kp8t62sj20kb3rafg))
- apparent randomness can arise from very simple deterministic systems ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn4achbrp6gz16srmrdg2wy))
    - Note: What does it mean to be deterministic? Here, example is of a well-defined function...I thought it was more like predictable
- For any value of *R* that yields chaos, uncertainty in any decimal place of *x*0, however far out in the decimal expansion, will result in unpredictability at some value of *t*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn4v7a88esecv7avcf9ss4a))
- the presence of chaos in a system implies that perfect prediction *à la* Laplace is impossible not only in practice but also *in principle*, since we can never know *x*0 to infinitely many decimal places ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn4x0h4t0tgcn8vbkpss7y8))
- In dynamical systems theory, each of these abrupt period doublings is called a *bifurcation*. This succession of bifurcations culminating in chaos has been called the “period doubling route to chaos.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn4yab9bja0af5meb8gjnv4))
- The symbol ∞ (“infinity”) is used to denote the onset of chaos—a trajectory with an infinite period ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn5170fej98pakkmpbce1t5))
- the common value of 4.6692016, now called *Feigenbaum’s constant*, is universal—which here means the same for all unimodal maps ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn52wbasjvbnx19jvxh28pw))
- *idea models*—models that are simple enough to study via mathematics or computers but that nonetheless capture fundamental properties of natural complex systems ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn5744t404ac94jd4cnss53))
- Energy is roughly defined as a system’s potential to “do work,” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn5brgvks23qt1wjrsp0v5q))
- work” done by an object: the amount of force applied to the object multiplied by the distance traveled by the object in the direction that force was applied ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn5b9ngqqhenafkpks6csxr))
- Entropy is a measure of the energy that cannot be converted into additional work ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn5cj84yh1fvb8a16pt0qsj))
- The “future” is defined as the direction of time in which entropy increases. Interestingly, the second law is the only fundamental law of physics that distinguishes between past and future ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn5eg7fh6cgvgdy5s0pvv86))
- the forward and backward interactions both obey the laws of physics. This is what *reversible* means ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn5f8epeyqcfmrmtb5x06g5))
- A *statistical* mechanics approach gives up on determining the exact position, velocity, and future behavior of each molecule and instead tries to predict the *average* positions and velocities of large *ensembles* of molecules ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn5se5atmtwgr0qgd18k51g))
- In short, classical mechanics attempts to say something about every single microscopic entity (e.g., molecule) by using Newton’s laws. Thermodynamics gives laws of macroscopic entities—heat, energy, and entropy—without acknowledging that any microscopic molecules are the source of these macroscopic entities. Statistical mechanics is a bridge between these two extremes, in that it explains how the behavior of the macroscopic entities arise from *statistics* of large ensembles of microscopic entities. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn5t5xd53e2fcahxcgfa13d))
- In statistical mechanics terminology, the particular collection of exact molecule positions and velocities at a given instant is called the *microstate* of the whole room at that instant ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn5w8je4aegkd795fnkh05q))
- A *type of microstate*, for example, “pictures all the same—you win” versus “pictures not all the same—you lose” or “molecules clumped together—we can’t breathe” versus “molecules uniformly spread out—we can breathe,” is called a *macrostate* of the system. A macrostate can correspond to many different microstates ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn5xqa189vjy0ea6vqtfznz))
- Boltzmann interpreted the second law of thermodynamics as simply saying that an isolated system will more likely be in a more probable macrostate than in a less probable one ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn5yrfc6nw33v2qhhvt9xj8))
- [Boltzmann defined the *entropy* of a macrostate](private://read/01hjmjw71wrcxrs61d9nzdxv03#filepos775983) as a function of the number of microstates that could give rise to that macrostate ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn5z42r553b3xs2v6jpjp5d))
- Shannon defined the information content in terms of the *entropy* of the message source ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn63695x63nv635h2nwpm0z))
- People have sometimes characterized Shannon’s definition of information content as the “average amount of surprise” a receiver experiences on receiving a message, in which “surprise” means something like the “degree of uncertainty” the receiver had about what the source would send next ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn7r1jmtvcd3h4p76kthxnc))
- the entropy (and thus information content) of a source is defined in terms of message probabilities and is not concerned with the “meaning” of a message. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn7rgc3r6m146q81wnw78ad))
- information is *processed* via computation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn7wdaxxgxefwc91dnb7eem))
    - Note: Producing results and actions.
- The input to the machine is the set of symbols written on the tape before the machine starts. The output from the machine is the set of symbols written on the tape after the machine halts ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn888t4x3mrnwkdysf63s66))
- The process of starting with input symbols on the tape and letting the Turing machine serially process that input by using such rules is called “running the Turing machine on the input.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn8cf1qeh8dtbm5xc3gxzm1))
- The idea is that, given a particular problem to solve, you can construct a definite procedure for solving it by designing a Turing machine that solves it. Turing machines were put forth as the *definition* of “definite procedure,” hitherto a vague and ill-defined notion ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn8ea6083xt0bm2xwjb5hve))
    - Note: Follows a precise set of steps
- one can design a special *universal* Turing machine (let’s call it *U*) that can emulate the workings of any other Turing machine. For *U* to emulate a Turing machine *M* running on an input *I*, *U* starts with part of its tape containing a sequence of 0s, 1s, and *blank*s that encodes input *I*, and part of its tape containing a sequence of 0s, 1s, and *blank*s that encodes machine *M* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn8gcw3sy29hxsr3pzm70v6))
- To have *U* emulate *M* running on input *I*, *U*’s initial tape contains both input *I* and *M*’s code. At each step *U* reads the current symbol in *I* from the input part of the tape, decodes the appropriate rule from the *M* part of the tape, and carries it out on the input part, all the while keeping track (on some other part of its tape) of what state *M* would be in if *M* were actually running on the given input. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn8mwphkqx9n117jgyxpsb6))
- what *U* does is precisely what a modern programmable computer does: it takes a program *M* that is stored in one part of memory, and runs it on an input *I* that is stored in another part of memory ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn8phc7pw8bgkfy8vwtej6r))
- **Turing Statement**: Turing machine *M*, given input *I*, will reach the **halt** state after a finite number of time steps ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn8tfzj2t4rt84mh0gz2160))
- Our assumption that there is a definite procedure that will decide the Turing Statement is equivalent to saying that we can design a Turing machine that is an infinite loop detector. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn8y55h4e96hq8dqspwr8k8))
- More specifically, our assumption says that we can design a Turing machine *H* that, given the code for any machine *M* and any input *I* on its tape, will, in finite time, answer “yes” if *M* would halt on input *I*, and “no” if *M* would go into an infinite loop and never halt.
  The problem of designing *H* is called the “Halting problem.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn8ya61rvha3zt33snkcjjk))
    - Note: H itself must always be able to halt!
- there can be no definite procedure for solving the Halting problem ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn92xk0r30q7mrt5b3gnn8r))
- The Halting problem is an example that proves that the answer to the *Entscheidungsproblem* is “no”; not every mathematical statement has a definite procedure that can decide its truth or falsity ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn936qsmwbz3cg21h1q2jeb))
- Gödel figured out a way to encode mathematical statements so that they could talk about themselves. Turing figured out a way to encode mathematical statements as Turing machines and thus run on one another ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn93hhecrergpe9dmd47180))
- THE SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS states that the total entropy of an isolated system will always increase until it reaches its maximum value. Everyone knows this instinctively—it happens not only in our understanding of science, but also in our daily lives, and is ingrained in humans’ conceptions of history and in our art, literature, and religions ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn99kbcbnpn04tvrwsd7b0q))
    - Note: Wow! How is this intuition captured in culture, collective understanding? Coincidence? Analogy making? Did it help influence the formulation of the second law?
- In a single stroke, the idea of evolution by natural selection unifies the realm of life, meaning, and purpose with the realm of space and time, cause and effect, mechanism and physical law ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn9crazgxhg49pf2bfm7xhs))
- Biological evolution is the process of gradual (and sometimes rapid) change in biological forms over the history of life ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn9db2cqx6rj0njagaejfrd))
- gradualism—that small causes, taken over long periods, can have very large effects ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjn9y9yyz409snap4hf7dfm2))
    - Note: Just saw this referenced in a Reddit thread about scientific misconceptions that were once consensus, lol: the idea of dinosaur extinction as being divine, then gradual, then caused by catastrophe.
- This book exposed him to Smith’s notion of the *invisible hand* in economics, whereby a collection of individuals acting in their own self-interest produces maximum benefit for the entire community. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjna0yfzm22jvcx4qk192nns))
- Gradual change over long periods can produce very large effects. Population growth combined with limited resources creates a struggle for existence. Collections of individuals acting in self-interested ways produce global benefit. Life seems to allow almost infinite variation, and a species’ particular traits seem designed for the very environment in which the species lives. Species branch out from common ancestors. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjna3zsp3f6fmsq90zep85k7))
    - Note: Cool...all ideas synthesized.
- Darwin called this process *evolution by natural selection* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjna4vyjd4mfbf5qa1p2wwnd))
- He wrote, “[Plato…says](private://read/01hjmjw71wrcxrs61d9nzdxv03#filepos784038) in Phaedo that our ‘necessary ideas’ arise from the preexistence of the soul, are not derivable from experience—read monkeys for preexistence ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjna7ra1st7nahhd1z6a9myh))
    - Note: What?
- Entropy decreases (living systems become more organized, seemingly more *designed*) as a result of the work done by natural selection. The energy for this work comes from the ability of individual organisms to metabolize energy from their environments (e.g., sunlight and food). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjnaddfzt5ezvnjnc5k2d1fw))
    - Note: Very cool connection/insight, seems to be a throwaway at the end of a section.
- Darwin’s theory asserted that evolution, and therefore variation, is continuous (i.e., organisms can differ from one another in arbitrarily minute ways) and Mendel’s theory proposed that variation is discrete (a pea plant is either tall or dwarf, but nothing in between). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjnc2yjmc7sy0e1xtv9pbpwa))
- Discrete variation in the *genes* of an organism can result in continuous-seeming variation in the organ-ism’s *phenotype*—the physical traits (e.g., height, skin color, etc.) resulting from these genes. Darwinism and Mendelism were finally recognized as being complementary, not opposed ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjnc4ched12p3a07kqy6nksf))
- long periods of no change in the morphology of organisms (and no new species emerging) punctuated by (relatively) short periods of large change in morphology, resulting in the emergence of new species. This pattern became labeled *punctuated equilibria*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjnc9jv2q42kzkq1ddfs14jv))
- *Historical contingency* refers to all the random accidents, large and small, that have contributed to the shaping of organisms ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjncaz6yy6h5gzmg1ykzf6es))
- Biological constraints refer to the limitations on what natural selection can create ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjncd1sc4nn9hm4vy1fn00k8))
- strict adaptationists”—those who insist that natural selection is the only possible explanation for complex organization in biology. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjnccpkgv6ny23pvvjvnbrpn))
- they, like virtually all biologists, still strongly embrace the basic ideas of Darwinism: that evolution has occurred over the last four billion years of life and continues to occur; that all modern species have originated from a single ancestor; that natural selection has played an important role in evolution; and that there is no “intelligent” force directing evolution or the design of organisms ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjncj2esmr5p46jvyacth1d3))
- an individual cell reproduces itself by dividing into two identical cells, during which process (dubbed *mitosis*) the chromosomes make identical copies of themselves ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjnck6rwczw6jnb4tbccmv9t))
- *Meiosis*, discovered about the same time, is the process in *diploid* organisms by which eggs and sperm are created. Diploid organisms, including most mammals and many other classes of organisms, are those in which chromosomes in all cells (except sperm and egg, or *germ* cells) are found in pairs (twenty-three pairs in humans) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjnckx6tzkaqc3by0c01f75y))
- It’s amazing how little energy this takes—if you sit around watching TV, say, all this subcellular activity will burn up fewer than 100 calories per hour. That’s because these processes are in part fueled by the random motion and collisions of huge numbers of molecules, which get their energy from the “ambient heat bath” (e.g., your warm living room). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjncx3p4nskrkgkp7zhp3mak))
- It is important to note that there is a wonderful self-reference here: All this complex cellular machinery—the mRNA, tRNA, ribosomes, polymerases, and so forth—that effect the transcription, translation, and replication of DNA are themselves encoded in that very DNA ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjncyx6wv8b515bmgqjaqpg3))
- there is not yet a single science of complexity but rather several different sciences of complexity with different notions of what complexity means ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjnd24ddfeyjnyf773g9hjzd))
