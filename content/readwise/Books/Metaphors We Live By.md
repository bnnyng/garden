- Full Title: Metaphors We Live By

# Highlights
- This is an example of what it means for a metaphorical concept, namely, ARGUMENT IS WAR, to structure (at least in part) what we do and how we understand what we are doing when we argue. The essence of metaphor is understanding and experiencing one kind of thing in terms of another. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpm2sr95gjhwc97me7f08fjv))
- metaphor is not just a matter of language, that is, of mere words. We shall argue that, on the contrary, human thought processes are largely metaphorical. This is what we mean when we say that the human conceptual system is metaphorically structured and defined. Metaphors as linguistic expressions are possible precisely because there are metaphors in a person's conceptual system. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpm2tvdectshw7vkr5ntbh0g))
