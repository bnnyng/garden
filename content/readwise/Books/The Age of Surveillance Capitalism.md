# Highlights
- Sur-veil-lance Cap-i-tal-ism, n. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsq08h16cc6qkkdjk79nsesd))
- Can the digital future be our home?” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsq0fsyhrbevajchn6x1t1c1))
- Home is where we know and where we are known, where we love and are beloved. Home is mastery, voice, relationship, and sanctuary: part freedom, part flourishing… part refuge, part prospect. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsq0e8dvyqjdmj2b7qcx7x4p))
    - Note: Fundamental claim: conscious (and even unconscious) beings need home to get “bearings.”
- Surveillance capitalism unilaterally claims human experience as free raw material for translation into behavioral data. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsq0p5f8czkfxcwnfvz83qav))
    - Note: Predictive (inferential) stats are implicated; behavioral futures markets is very interesting! Data being used to predict ED relapses, etc..
- Instrumentarian power knows and shapes human behavior toward others’ ends. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsq0v24t1c3mqs9evqcfz9bk))
- Instead, it strips away the illusion that the networked form has some kind of indigenous moral content, that being “connected” is somehow intrinsically pro-social, innately inclusive, or naturally tending toward the democratization of knowledge. Digital connection is now a means to others’ commercial ends. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsq0z84typptp8t5w4wkskdz))
    - Note: Feels like a lot of thought pieces and internet opinion writers are only just now realizing this!
- We are the sources of surveillance capitalism’s crucial surplus: the objects of a technologically advanced and increasingly inescapable raw-material-extraction operation. Surveillance capitalism’s actual customers are the enterprises that trade in its markets for future behavior. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsq150fzxhnr1r5bhexwq2fp))
    - Note: Crucial distinction between this and direct consumption?
- Our dependency is at the heart of the commercial surveillance project, in which our felt needs for effective life vie against the inclination to resist its bold incursions. This conflict produces a psychic numbing that inures us to the realities of being tracked, parsed, mined, and modified. It disposes us to rationalize the situation in resigned cynicism, create excuses that operate like defense mechanisms (“I have nothing to hide”), or find other ways to stick our heads in the sand, choosing ignorance out of frustration and helplessness ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsq17hhzvngft50j3b32cs2r))
    - Note: This,and the whole paragraphs, hits so strongly—certainly had this conversation with Maeve last week.
- This is how the unprecedented reliably confounds understanding; existing lenses illuminate the familiar, thus obscuring the original by turning the unprecedented into an extension of the past. This contributes to the normalization of the abnormal, which makes fighting the unprecedented even more of an uphill climb. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsq1cwx9rmk81q8chnw5xbcf))
    - Note: “Normalization of the abnormal” makes fighting the unprecedented exceptionally difficult—eye opening take!
- Surveillance capitalism is not technology; it is a logic that imbues technology and commands it into action. Surveillance capitalism is a market form that is unimaginable outside the digital milieu, but it is not the same as the “digital.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsq2tce2wtnntdfyqv3yqrgk))
    - Note: This is importance because SCs want subjects to conflate the two, to see them as inevitable.
- technology is not and never can be a thing in itself, isolated from economics and society. This means that technological inevitability does not exist. Technologies are always economic means, not ends in themselves: in modern times, technology’s DNA comes already patterned by what the sociologist Max Weber called the “economic orientation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsq2zackz7n2nr42mqsvdty1))
    - Note: Weber: technology is always a means to economic ends.
- In a modern capitalist society, technology was, is, and always will be an expression of the economic objectives that direct it into action. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsq30sdb01rqcapygvsm1208))
    - Note: Chiang’s “AI is the new McKinsey” now becomes obvious enough to be banal.
- The inversion implied a larger story of a commercial reformation in which the digital era finally offered the tools to shift the focus of consumption from the mass to the individual, liberating and reconfiguring capitalism’s operations and assets. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsq46xms8ar441df1h6hh0tx))
    - Note: Apple completely inverted consumption from mass (subject to production lines) to individualized
- In offering consumers respite from an institutional world that was indifferent to their individual needs, it opened the door to the possibility of a new rational capitalism able to reunite supply and demand by connecting us to what we really want in exactly the ways that we choose. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsq48scehnzy9hsvwd8vq4zm))
    - Note: “Emancipatory”, a surprisingly optimistic tone!
- The division of labor appears to us otherwise than it does to economists. For them, it essentially consists in greater production. For us, this greater productivity is only a necessary consequence, a repercussion of the phenomenon. If we specialize, it is not to produce more, but it is to enable us to live in the *new conditions of existence* that have been made for us.[7](private://read/01hsfm1z7ymq8k5vf4g69b6fhw/#en0022en) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsq4p3v27p1fbndznxydx8f8))
    - Note: Still don’t quite grasp what exactly is the cause? Where did the conditions of existence come from then? Wary of universal explanations a bit.
- If work becomes more divided,” it is because the “struggle for existence is more acute.”[8](private://read/01hsfm1z7ymq8k5vf4g69b6fhw/#en0023en) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsq4vfabg1gcbknzzcwamdcf))
- This “first modernity” marks the time when life became “individualized” for great numbers of people as they separated from traditional norms, meanings, and rules.[11](private://read/01hsfm1z7ymq8k5vf4g69b6fhw/#en0026en) That meant each life became an open-ended reality to be discovered rather than a certainty to be enacted. Even where the traditional world remains intact for many people today, it can no longer be experienced as the only possible story. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsq4xmzb2eaq3drjpxn6908a))
    - Note: C.f. modernism in literature!
- What began as a modern migration from traditional lifeways bloomed into a new society of people born to a sense of psychological individuality, with its double-edged birthright of liberation and necessity. We experience both the right and the requirement to choose our own lives. No longer content to be anonymous members of the mass, we feel our entitlement to self-determination ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsq5a8b9rt82b3qf6ryt1wx8))
- The hierarchical social compact and mass society of the first modernity promised predictable rewards, but their very success was the knife that cut us loose and sent us tumbling onto the shores of the second modernity, propelling us toward more-intricate and richly patterned lives. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsq58hpfz29q1xte6b564p60))
    - Note: This thing about English language and western education = more rich lives seems like a hot take somehow, but perhaps it’s true? // In the second modernity, “self is all we have” as opposed to what? Why is tradition no longer accessible even as an option? Or does “existence” of self simply precede all?….oh okay this is stated in the next paragraph lol.
- the individual as the author of his or her own life is the protagonist of our age, whether we experience this fact as emancipation or affliction.[16](private://read/01hsfm1z7ymq8k5vf4g69b6fhw/#en0031en) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsq5fdkh07jx86atyntcbcct))
