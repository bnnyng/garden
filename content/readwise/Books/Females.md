# Highlights
- “The two-sex system *must* be right,” he protests, “it’s survived hundreds of thousands of years.” “So has disease,” Bongi shoots back. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyxavc0x986cxacfvs6h2z3n))
- “The male is a biological accident,” Solanas declares in her opening salvo. “The Y (male) gene is an incomplete X (female) gene … In other words, the male is an incomplete female, a walking abortion, aborted at the gene stage.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyxaw7t27rc4767bbhc5d37k))
- By gender-swapping the sexes, in other words, the *SCUM Manifesto* effectively proposes *misogyny against men*. The truth is that Valerie, so remembered for her man-hating, hates most women even more. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyxbar6g1yptbaxa0he8ewdj))
- the mission of SCUM—a select group of “dominant, secure, self-confident, nasty, violent, selfish, independent, proud, thrill-seeking, free-wheeling, arrogant females”—is not simply to kill men and smash the government but ultimately to *defeminize* the human race altogether. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyxbbtd4pxke59aw34rs8374))
- femaleness is a universal sex defined by self-negation, against which all politics, even feminist politics, rebels. Put more simply: Everyone is female, and everyone hates it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyxbn8dt32raaf1jqsvjj2xm))
    - Note: KEY THESIS.
- I’ll define as *female* any psychic operation in which the self is sacrificed to make room for the desires of another. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyxbpdvyaf6acqjqj2yt1d8n))
- To be female is to let someone else do your desiring for you, at your own expense. This means that femaleness, while it hurts only sometimes, is always bad for you. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyxbqn7jmm5r0t0y6bbgeshn))
    - Note: Would like to"bad" to be more defined—why does this immediately mean bad?

- Femaleness is not an anatomical or genetic characteristic of an organism, but rather a universal existential condition, the one and only structure of human consciousness. To be is to be female: the two are identical. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz4a0kny73e4bjhaxr4cfv0e))
- Everyone is female, but how one *copes with* being female—the specific defense mechanisms that one consciously or unconsciously develops as a reaction formation *against* one’s femaleness, within the terms of what is historically and socioculturally available—this is what we ordinarily call *gender*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz4a3jnd35tw33n8ach6vz8e))
- that human civilization represents a diverse array of attempts to suppress and mitigate femaleness, that this is in fact the implicit purpose of all human activity, and, most of all, that activity we call politics. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz4a24p2t180013jgcw8avk7))
- politics begins, in every case, from the optimistic belief that *another sex is possible*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz4a2f7stv2fb9zwjnpt762x))
