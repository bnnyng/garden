- Full Title: Sleeveless

# Highlights
- You can’t move here and expect to be able to live the way the locals do, relaxing into their adult lives, frequenting their favorite Manhattan haunts, maintaining deep-rooted friendships. Instead, the best you can hope for is to make friends who make time for you, and who would not disagree when you publicized your closeness.

- “Our business is complicated because intimacy is part and parcel of our profession; as actors we are paid to do very intimate things in public,” Nyong’o wrote. She demonized the perpetrators while tearing a little hole in the sheet that separated the people in power from their victims.

- I wanted to watch the patriarchy go up in flames, but I wasn’t excited about what was being pitched to replace it. If we got all of it out in the open, what would we have left? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqph7wvr9zyj2pwgd65zcr2e))
    - Note: I think I prefer Gaitskill’s treatment of the movement…though I barely remember it. This is interesting, more lives (existence preceding essence is exactly New York?)
- The simple fact that young people were so obsessed with any product contradicted Party ideology. Members of the older generation lamented the substitution of material goods for spiritual ones. Jeans culture was a type of philistinism, and slogans like ‘prosperity without culture’ and ‘predatory consumerism’ entered into anti-jeans rhetoric.

    - Note: Katherine Damm on jeans in the Soviet Union.
- this is a styling choice more than it is a direction for the clothing we later see in stores. (Styling, even more so than separates, conveys a collection’s coherent message, if it has one.) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqpg43p79kvn5mt368epbhbw))
- This is fashion at its best, and its most frightening—a fashion that mines the past to predict the future. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqpg3qerspzm85c5a47ehj4d))
- our current interest in a post-Communist aesthetic is rebellious in a different way, layered as it is in nostalgia.
  Which is why fashion lately is being pushed to self-consciously combat mass political ambivalence. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqpg7snbea33hp0c9ycn5q8f))
    - Note: Why are the two linked?
- The semiotics of this trend worry me. Best-case scenario, designers are suggesting that we don the most useful disguise available, the better to infiltrate the power structure and enact subversions. But in a season where there was a lot of punting going on, I’m more inclined to believe this was an homage to the power structure itself ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqpg62myk3d7t2fxf54fzj89))
    - Note: “Who is meant to wear these suiting trends?”
