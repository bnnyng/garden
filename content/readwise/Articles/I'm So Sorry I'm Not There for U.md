# Highlights
- my own karma is baked in. the problem is that i did survive. that the malnutrition— the protein in my urine, loss of white blood cells, loss of hair, a permanent loss of appetite, yeast infections so viral and strong willed that it changed my yonic chemistry and how i fuck forever—did not do me in. my hot little body with a natural curve from waist to hip returned as it once was. my hair grew long again. my teeth were repaired by a dentist. i got fat in my hips and my arms. i still have chronically dehydrated cowboy skin but egyptian magic and tallow help with that. i did not firstly die. what i went through was, in fact, not enough to kill me.
