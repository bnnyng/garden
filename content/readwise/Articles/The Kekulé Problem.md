# Highlights
- The unconscious is a biological system before it is anything else. To put it as pithily as possibly—and as accurately—the unconscious is a machine for operating an animal. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs5v709c860qtg9f4bztkyrd))
- Problems in general are often well posed in terms of language and language remains a handy tool for explaining them. But the actual process of thinking—in any discipline—is largely an unconscious affair. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs5vahyp978asw982hyvgsh0))
    - Note: Thesis.
- atavistic ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hs6xgsrn5c62fwvn4fyd5vw1))
    - Note: In evolution, when an old trait re-dominates.

- We might further point out that when it arrived it had no place to go. The brain was not expecting it and had made no plans for its arrival. It simply invaded those areas of the brain that were the least dedicated. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsbvgr299ck71k4qng6kh7rt))
    - Note: Is this fr? Lol
- The difference between the history of a virus and that of language is that the virus has arrived by way of Darwinian selection and language has not. The virus comes nicely machined. Offer it up. Turn it slightly. Push it in. Click. Nice fit. But the scrap heap will be found to contain any number of viruses that did not fit.

    - Note: Language as a parasitic invasion.
- The rule is that languages have followed their own requirements. The rule is that they are charged with describing the world. There is nothing else to describe. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsbvvr1f9ng2s26d86h6es08))
- What we do know—pretty much without question—is that once you have language everything else follows pretty quickly. The simple understanding that one thing can be another thing is at the root of all things of our doing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsbvxht64nhm26d9630pfgs1))
    - Note: Representation, computationalism.
- But the fact that the unconscious prefers avoiding verbal instructions pretty much altogether—even where they would appear to be quite useful—suggests rather strongly that it doesnt much like language and even that it doesnt trust it. And why is that? How about for the good and sufficient reason that it has been getting along quite well without it for a couple of million years?

- Parables of course often want to resolve themselves into the pictorial. When you first heard of Plato’s cave you set about reconstructing it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsbw1sc3ddqhyf4vjmxpp2dn))
- The unconscious is a biological operative and language is not. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsbw27jr8fa0zbjv2qrk1wdq))
    - Note: Main thesis. Relationship with Cartesian dualism, lol?
- The unconscious is just not used to giving verbal instructions and is not happy doing so. Habits of two million years duration are hard to break. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsc1kvh41t4987p4wh3xn0ka))
