## Highlights
- To distinguish different phases, one considers macroscopic, measurable properties of the system, so-called *order parameters*. One then observes how these order parameters change as an ambient property, the so-called *control parameter*, is varied. In general, a smooth change in the control parameter leads to a smooth change in the order parameters. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7tksrcevkbw2absv566fyj0))

- However, there are certain points where the values of the order parameters jump or make sharp turns, see Figure [​1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4171833/figure/F1/). These points mark boundaries between different phases, and moving the control parameter across such a boundary causes a *phase transition*.

- If a system has a continuous phase transition, then the system can reside exactly at the transition point between two phases. This state on the edge between two qualitatively different types of behavior is called the *critical state*, and in this state the system is *at criticality*. Because phase transitions usually break certain symmetries of the system, they often separate an ordered state from a less ordered state. Critical states are therefore said to be on the *edge of chaos*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7tkv0qawaegd12htzgab46e))

- As we discuss in detail below, systems at criticality are believed to have optimal memory and information processing capabilities. This general theoretical prediction was verified in many specific models such as boolean networks (Kauffman, [1984](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4171833/#B46); Derrida and Pomeau, [1986](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4171833/#B26)), liquid state machines (Langton, [1990](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4171833/#B53)), and neuronal networks (Maass et al., [2002](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4171833/#B61); Bertschinger and Natschläger, [2004](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4171833/#B13)), for a review also see Legenstein and Maass ([2007](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4171833/#B56)). These findings inspired the *criticality hypothesis*, which proposes that the brain operates in a critical state because the associated optimal computational capabilities should be evolutionarily selected for.
