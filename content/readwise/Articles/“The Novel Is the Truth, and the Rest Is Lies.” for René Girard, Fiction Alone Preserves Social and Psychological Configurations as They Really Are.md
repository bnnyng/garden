- Yet the process is unwitting—mobs do not knowingly pick a scapegoat. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hywrw290c9kyyde5ppafpce0))

    - Note: Myth or personal autonomy.
- Mimesis is the basic tool of human development: it is how we learn to eat and talk, the root of our ambitions, the fuel for our unquenchable longings ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyws99vvgwgh588bry4vv7b1))
- We learn what to want from each other, and our desires spread contagiously because we copy each other ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyws9qg6dh8pe9pxxv1g2qp7))

    - Note: Plot.
- It begins instead in the loneliness of the human heart.

Action works as a fixative to our understanding. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyxa20ajkp50nsw4tqydhxae))
