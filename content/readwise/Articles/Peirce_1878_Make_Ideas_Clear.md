# Highlights
- A clear idea is defined as one which is so apprehended that it will be recognized wherever it is met with, and so that no other will be mistaken for it. If it fails of this clearness, it is said to be obscure. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htx8h836h4j4z4y9c1jhyd46))
    - Note: Interesting notion of clear, depends on application with reception as a consequence. Assumption that the idea generalizes to different situations
- A distinct idea is defined as one which contains nothing which is not clear. This is technical language; by the *contents* of an idea logicians understand whatever is contained in its definition. So that an idea is *distinctly* apprehended, according to them, when we can give a precise definition of it, in abstract terms. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htx8n8zbt4nfzfd7f9arnpm4))
- the machinery of the mind can only transform knowledge, but never originate it, unless it be fed with facts of observation. He thus missed the most essential point of the Cartesian philosophy, which is, that to accept propositions which seem perfectly evident to us is a thing which, whether it be logical or illogical, we cannot help doing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htx8rzh4zxyn9e8e1m1dn5ya))
- The page of history is not yet unrolled that is to tell us whether such a people will or will not in the long run prevail over one whose ideas (like the words of their language) are few, but which possesses a wonderful mastery over those which it has. For an individual, however, there can be no question that a few clear ideas are worth more than many confused ones ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htx8w8bsh4waam2xmsfp30sb))
- It is terrible to see how a single unclear idea, a single formula without meaning, lurking in a young man's head, will sometimes act like an obstruction of inert matter in an artery, hindering the nutrition of the brain, and condemning its victim to pine away in the fullness of his intellectual vigor and in the midst of intellectual plenty. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htx8x4frzets542ma54496fb))
- Feigned hesitancy, whether feigned for mere amusement or with a lofty purpose, plays a great part in the production of scientific inquiry. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htx9195t43r0mtgv8y7xbej3))
    - Note: Similar theme as reasoning divorced from content somehowâ€¦
- we find ourselves decided as to how we should act under such circumstances as those which occasioned our hesitation. In other words, we have attained belief. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htx92m6ft3w9hp2eyar1mww9))
- These two sorts of objects, what we are *immediately* conscious of and what we are *mediately* conscious of, are found in all consciousness. Some elements (the sensations) are completely present at every instant so long as they last, while others (like thought) are actions having beginning, middle, and end, and consist in a congruence in the succession of sensations which flow through the mind. They cannot be immediately present to us, but must cover some portion of the past or future. Thought is a thread of melody running through the succession of our sensations. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htx94nv4k5vs13s2kp9287n3))
- Thought is only one such system, for its sole motive, idea, and function is to produce belief, and whatever does not concern that purpose belongs to some other system of relations. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htx95btewg2a68es9j5k8q0a))
    - Note: Note: 5e only role of thought is to produce belief.
- Thought in action has for its only possible motive the attainment of thought at rest; and whatever does not refer to belief is no part of the thought itself. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htx97fgy3dhvmj41mnyzyg7q))
    - Note: What is thought at rest, a state of non discomfort?
- We have seen that it has just three properties: First, it is something that we are aware of; second, it appeases the irritation of doubt; and, third, it involves the establishment in our nature of a rule of action, or, say for short, a *habit.* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htx98gx4s7fxcdgzg2nt096c))
    - Note: Note: three properties of belief
- belief is only a stadium of mental action, an effect upon our nature due to thought, which will influence future thinking. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htx99rktxnn6q5hs9x0twe0f))
- One singular deception of this sort, which often occurs, is to mistake the sensation produced by our own unclearness of thought for a character of the object we are thinking. Instead of perceiving that the obscurity is purely subjective, we fancy that we contemplate a quality of the object which is essentially mysterious; and if our conception be afterward presented to us in a clear form we do not recognize it as the same, owing to the absence of the feeling of unintelligibility ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv009w5v22g1zb69t9p5ch08))
    - Note: Examples?
- whatever there is connected with a thought, but irrelevant to its purpose, is an accretion to it, but no part of it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv00c13tsetnvcnheyyvqq60))
- what a thing means is simply what habits it involves ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv00dba9gxqdjkkbbcdc2qww))
- we come down to what is tangible and conceivably practical, as the root of every real distinction of thought, no matter how subtile it may be; ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv00ejwx6f6d91m6b8jzb1rw))
    - Note: Difference in thoughts depends on physical reality and perception. Related to generalization based on data; extend definition of reality to data? Is perception reducible to taking in inputs like this?
- Such beliefs are nothing but self-notifications that we should, upon occasion, act in regard to such things as we believe to be wine according to the qualities which we believe wine to possess. The occasion of such action would be some sensible perception, the motive of it to produce some sensible result. Thus our action has exclusive reference to what affects the senses, our habit has the same bearing as our action, our belief the same as our habit, our conception the same as our belief; and we can consequently mean nothing by wine but what has certain effects, direct or indirect, upon our senses; and to talk of something as having all the sensible characters of wine, yet being in reality blood, is senseless jargon. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv00nprk3jh6bn4eg1avfhmy))
- Our idea of anything *is* our idea of its sensible effects; ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv00pxjv4jkt83fspxygxypx))
    - Note: Can senseless artificial agents have ideas?
- Consider what effects, that might conceivably have practical bearings, we conceive the object of our conception to have. Then, our conception of these effects is the whole of our conception of the object ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv00rtyhg2bgmcz7yb5ewqky))
- Reflection will show that the reply is this: there would be no *falsity* in such modes of speech. They would involve a modification of our present usage of speech with regard to the words hard and soft, but not of their meanings. For they represent no fact to be different from what it is; ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv00x7eb4jh2m1fkyyhm7pj0))
    - Note: What is the purpose of causal explanations?
- For example, the question of free-will and fate in its simplest form, stripped of verbiage, is something like this: I have done something of which I am ashamed; could I, by an effort of the will, have resisted the temptation, and done otherwise? The philosophical reply is, that this is not a question of fact, but only of the arrangement of facts. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv011z76zxa3ddaaj1wp3k20))
- There is no objection to a contradiction in what would result from a false supposition. The *reductio ad absurdum* consists in showing that contradictory results would follow from a hypothesis which is consequently judged to be false. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv018nka0zcbmyhmx2w9w87g))
    - Note: I don't understand this paragraph
- In a recent admired work on Analytic Mechanics it is stated that we understand precisely the effect of force, but what force itself is we do not understand! This is simply a self-contradiction. The idea which the word force excites in our minds has no other function than to affect our actions, and these actions can have no reference to force otherwise than through its effects. Consequently, if we know what the effects of force are, we are acquainted with every fact which is implied in saying that a force exists, and there is nothing more to know. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv01m3n7vx4pvd9ht0knp9nn))
    - Note: Need to ponder my orb about whether I agree!
- Thus we may define the real as that whose characters are independent of what anybody may think them to be. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv5pppw8whwe5k6mxjzg1g6c))
    - Note: Very perplexed by this definition of reality!
- According to them, reality, like every other quality, consists in the peculiar sensible effects which things partaking of it produce. The only effect which real things have is to cause belief, for all the sensations which they excite emerge into consciousness in the form of beliefs ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv5ptj6jpc5dsx63tynrctsd))
- Still, it will sometimes strike a scientific man that the philosophers have been less intent on finding out what the facts are, than on inquiring what belief is most in harmony with their system. It is hard to convince a follower of the *a priori* method by adducing facts; but show him that an opinion he is defending is inconsistent with what he has laid down elsewhere, and he will be very apt to retract it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv5pxr59pa055684748ppbfq))
- In contenting themselves with fixing their own opinions by a method which would lead another man to a different result, they betray their feeble hold of the conception of what truth is. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv5pya276p2yvc1qpvpq493x))
    - Note: Supremacy of scientific truth over philosophical truth...what is the end point of this line of argument?
- On the other hand, all the followers of science are animated by a cheerful hope that the processes of investigation, if only pushed far enough, will give one certain solution to each question to which they apply it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv5pz9rqrhjc55539vnbcjxw))
    - Note: What of the paradigm shift? There is still much subjective belief in science, based on Kuhn's framework?
- The opinion which is fated to be ultimately agreed to by all who investigate, is what we mean by the truth, and the object represented in this opinion is the real. That is the way I would explain reality. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv5q1z3tvdd0yxtdbc97bwfm))
- on the one hand, reality is independent, not necessarily of thought in general, but only of what you or I or any finite number of men may think about it; and that, on the other hand, though the object of the final opinion depends on what that opinion is, yet what that opinion is does not depend on what you or I or any man thinks ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv5q2zfs6p5yfam4c4ar6hpa))
    - Note: Truth is a quality determined among societies.
- Truth crushed to earth shall rise again," and the opinion which would finally result from investigation does not depend on how anybody may actually
  think. But the reality of that which is real does depend on the real fact that investigation is destined to lead, at last, if continued long enough, to a belief in it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv5q48h9fp7pfh45cv2mv342))
    - Note: Belief is a consequence of investigation into the truth, truth does not (or should not) follow from stubborn position of belief.
- it is unphilosophical to suppose that, with regard to any given question (which has any clear meaning), investigation would not bring forth a solution of it, if it were carried far enough. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv5q91n28yp87b6we37hm2x4))
    - Note: Scientific method can solve any question about truth. What of truths and phenomena we cannot yet conceive of, either because we can't perceive them physically or with the current paradigm, cognitively?
- metaphysics is a subject much more curious than useful, the knowledge of which, like that of a sunken reef, serves chiefly to enable us to keep clear of it ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvedbjbrzv46zxtc3xhd24pv))
