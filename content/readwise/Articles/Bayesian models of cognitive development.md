# Highlights
- On one side, a purely nativist response was to deny learning, and to focus on charac- terizing the detailed representations that were already in place. On another side, an empiricist response was to suggest that structured representations were not necessary, that learning (and the inferences that followed) was simply a bottom-up process of learning statistical associations.

- theory-based probabilistic models of development provide a means to characterize core and intuitive beliefs in terms of representations. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq9h28as95mt7hsx9q46qqf2))
- The problem can be broken down into three related questions. First, how do children generalize from examples? Second, how do children learn the inductive biases that shape generalization from examples? Third, how do children learn the frameworks that shape the inductive biases that influence generalization from examples? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq9h1vhr4k7wtht3q8t75rrk))
- Crucial breakthroughs are waiting for the right program learning models that take seriously the need for the last stages of a hierarchy to make contact with the basic input units of perception. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq9gys5m10wcq3kfznsq0my8))
