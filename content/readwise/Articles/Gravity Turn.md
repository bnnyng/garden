## Highlights
- Similarly, a successful research professor is embedded in an intricate system that, as surely as Newton’s laws, keeps her in a state of steadily producing new research. Many of her ground-breaking papers are not one-off productions - they produce sequels, variants, and interdisciplinary applications year after year. She has cultivated dozens of long-time collaborators of the highest level who freely share ideas and research directions, and has the reputation to find more at will. She attends conferences every other month that keep her updated on the leading edge of the field. Every year her research group grows, as if by clockwork, adding a couple graduate students and postdocs to whom she can delegate projects with only the gentlest supervision.

    - Note: I'm really not sure I want this! The idea of free falling is somewhat ungrounded, unglamorous, and unappealing to me...do I want something more stable instead? Maybe as a person who fails to instill structure in their life, I need something to be structured for me...but wouldn't this be an ideal routine, if I can get there?
- A natural question remains: if many graduate school activities only count for temporary vertical altitude, what constitutes horizontal motion that is useful for permanently entering orbit? Examples include:
  1. Producing good research, as every nice paper you write continues to pay dividends year after year.
  2. Becoming an attractive collaborator, partly by acquiring enough reputation that people are willing to work with you, and partly by being productive and pleasant enough that they stick around.
  3. Learning to support the research of others, as much of your potential impact lies not in personal contribution, but in the network effects accumulated from being a positive community member.
  This last skill begins at the very start of graduate school, where the biggest immediate impact you can likely have is facilitating your adviser’s and other collaborators’ research. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h958v7jedvkte8kz4fzh4h9t))
