- The internet is—as a faceless medium, as a medium of seeing without being seen—an essentially *shameless* medium.

- “The internet is entropic to the realization of political form; it is a force of political incoherence and discoherence.” At the same time, our politics is illegible without the internet; Trump’s “Twitter presidency” is a case in point.
