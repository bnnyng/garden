# Highlights
- The dignity of the novel lay in its refusal to have something so vulgar as a direction ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmtzzn544k1bhfhf642g6wr7))
- Her *Idiot* possesses delicacy, humor and weight. But is it a book we actually want to read? And if not, what can it tell us about the kind of reading we do want? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmtzypyqvtvtaazzbsa9fb6j))
- mots justes ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmv0rpad2v08j6qt62fzqzs1))
- It also means that every figure in the novel besides Selin (including Ivan and Svetlana) is forgettable: whatever their degree of sound, fury, they can signify nothing within a narrative field of vision ruled by an invincible solipsism. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmv0j3nyj2czfnm7yfxxypaf))
- aperçus ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmv0t6a7zzxhy55e7t5s1tnm))
- Is it because it possesses what we now call realism—a staunch fidelity to concrete details filtered seamlessly into intimations of mood? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmv0wcswj1xhf1p87z03x0rg))
- The quantum facts of daily life, the pawnshops, manors, samovars, Thursday evenings and horse-driven cabs, were to this novel what the skin is to the body: a surface of mostly dead matter whose purpose was informing, concealing and protecting all the other vital systems. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmv12jd44vbsppskakcw2k4e))
- The “reality” of this ideological realism was not inert material to be quarried and crafted, but animate: a triple collision between the individual conscience, the society in which the idiot operates, and the ideology (conquistador chivalry, Promethean science, Gnostic materialism, Napoleonic romanticism, revolutionary communism, Gatsbian romanticism, revolutionary communism, white supremacy) that would shape conscience and society according to its own dictates. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmv11yb0cgfzrzybd5k62c8e))
- Novels are written to challenge a contemporary audience first, not in pursuit of timeless posterity. Yet if the ideologically engaged literature of the past still rings true today, it is because the distance between splenetic existence and essential ideals has altered less than one imagines. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmv7nvfgfzh83z30tp1b7n9t))
- so long as the writer’s biography, as opposed to the horizons of collective belief of the writer’s era, remain the novel’s primary frame of reference, it can’t. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmv7tpatf8x01sddhqxn3y3x))
- it was easy to conclude that there was nothing bigger than the self left to believe in ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmv7v8qyf7ze1yypghzp8b1m))
- Autofiction, a sort of aesthetic edition of careerism, was the logical endpoint of realism’s exclusive valorization of individual experience: once all other recreations expose their artifice and exhaust their charm, what is left except to chart one’s own advancement through a world as fixed as it is real?
