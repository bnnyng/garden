# Highlights
- There are, first of all, two kinds of authors: those who write for the subject’s sake, and those who write for writing’s sake. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqphg3nen5rraqk0ks6q2n6a))
    - Note: Banger of an introductory line.
- ances. As soon as this is perceived the book should be thrown away, for time is precious. As a matter of fact, the author is cheating the reader as soon as he writes for the sake of filling up paper; because his pretext for writing is that he has something to impart.

    - Note: To write for purely writing’s sake is deceiving the reader; implicit assumption that the writing is to send information to others. Deception involves lack of utility, falsehood?
- It is only the man who writes absolutely for the sake of the subject that writes anything worth writing. What an inestimable advantage it would be, if, in every branch of literature, there existed ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqphfsgzx5388fgqxcg0jze3))
- In the first place, there are those who write without thinking. They write from memory, from reminiscences, or even direct from other people’s books. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqphjn3jkxjprtnadktw2mdw))
    - Note: Contemporary literary and autofiction; further insipid because modern identities blur together.
- ho think whilst they are writing. They think in order to write; and they are numerous. In the third place, there are those who have thought before they begin to write. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqphn0smzc1z56hskc29mb7a))
    - Note: Key premise.
- about the books written on this subject, and what has been said by others upon it, I mean. In order to think, they must have the more direct and powerful incentive of other people’s thoughts. These become their next theme, and therefore they always remain under their influence and are never, strictly speaking, original. On the contrary, the former are roused to thought through the subject itself, hence their thinking is directed immediately to it.

    - Note: Even further delineation. Great writers are capable of “original” thought. Where does original forms of synthesis fall on this continuum?
- No greater mistake can be made than to imagine that what has been written latest is always the more correct; that what is written later on is an improvement on what was written previously; and that every change means progress. Men who think and have correct judgment, and people who treat their subject earnestly, are all exceptions only. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqphv1g860v8711wzsrsvwvx))
    - Note: As mentioned with brandy example, different terrain from technical and science writing? But why? An Aristotelian “lower craft,” whereas pure contemplation is a privileged activity?
      Edit: seeing science referenced later in this paragraph. Okay, alternative is the paradigm shift? Any interaction between Schopenhauer and Kuhn?
