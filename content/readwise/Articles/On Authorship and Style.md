# Highlights
- There are, first of all, two kinds of authors: those who write for the subject’s sake, and those who write for writing’s sake. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqphg3nen5rraqk0ks6q2n6a))
    - Note: Banger of an introductory line.
- ances. As soon as this is perceived the book should be thrown away, for time is precious. As a matter of fact, the author is cheating the reader as soon as he writes for the sake of filling up paper; because his pretext for writing is that he has something to impart. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqphczz2xfwexh03p68y7zk9))
    - Note: To write for purely writing’s sake is deceiving the reader; implicit assumption that the writing is to send information to others. Deception involves lack of utility, falsehood?
- It is only the man who writes absolutely for the sake of the subject that writes anything worth writing. What an inestimable advantage it would be, if, in every branch of literature, there existed ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqphfsgzx5388fgqxcg0jze3))
- In the first place, there are those who write without thinking. They write from memory, from reminiscences, or even direct from other people’s books. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqphjn3jkxjprtnadktw2mdw))
    - Note: Contemporary literary and autofiction; further insipid because modern identities blur together.
- ho think whilst they are writing. They think in order to write; and they are numerous. In the third place, there are those who have thought before they begin to write. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqphn0smzc1z56hskc29mb7a))
    - Note: Key premise.
- about the books written on this subject, and what has been said by others upon it, I mean. In order to think, they must have the more direct and powerful incentive of other people’s thoughts. These become their next theme, and therefore they always remain under their influence and are never, strictly speaking, original. On the contrary, the former are roused to thought through the subject itself, hence their thinking is directed immediately to it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqphqkw806sn7kzdk37xy4cg))
    - Note: Even further delineation. Great writers are capable of “original” thought. Where does original forms of synthesis fall on this continuum?
- No greater mistake can be made than to imagine that what has been written latest is always the more correct; that what is written later on is an improvement on what was written previously; and that every change means progress. Men who think and have correct judgment, and people who treat their subject earnestly, are all exceptions only. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqphv1g860v8711wzsrsvwvx))
    - Note: As mentioned with brandy example, different terrain from technical and science writing? But why? An Aristotelian “lower craft,” whereas pure contemplation is a privileged activity?
      Edit: seeing science referenced later in this paragraph. Okay, alternative is the paradigm shift? Any interaction between Schopenhauer and Kuhn?

- Hence the course of science is often retrogressive. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr3sfmnmqycwn8txptbx37d5))
    - Note: This is a hot take! From whence does it all originate? What is the criterion of truth, according to S?
- what is new is seldom good; because a good thing is only new for a short time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr3sha2q4n6x3gm3qbrh5539))
    - Note: Why does the first part follow from the latter?
- A book can never be anything more than the impression of its author’s thoughts. The value of these thoughts lies either in the matter about which he has thought, or in the form in which he develops his matter — that is to say, what he has thought about it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr3skmq9j60b35e2sdmhqx1j))
    - Note: Matter is made rare by circumstance; form by the author's own capabilities and intellect. Both parametrize book value.
- It is most laughable the way the public reveals its liking for matter in poetic works; it carefully investigates the real events or personal circumstances of the poet’s life which served to give the motif of his works; nay, finally, it finds these more interesting than the works themselves; ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr3sszzbf5918kebcgyh5qad))
    - Note: On the role of creator in a work. Relation to the term "death of the artist"?
- It is chiefly intelligence, judgment, wit, and vivacity that enable a man to converse; they give form to the conversation. However, the matter of the conversation must soon come into notice — in other words, that about which one can talk to the man, namely, his knowledge. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr3t7rczbvs0eqj77cs4e6tx))
    - Note: Same trade-off within writing? Conversation as a demonstration of the trade-off.
- A thought only really lives until it has reached the boundary line of words; it then becomes petrified and dies immediately; yet it is as everlasting as the fossilised animals and plants of former ages. Its existence, which is really momentary, may be compared to a crystal the instant it becomes crystallised. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr3t52htgj8jvcx98qx5r0c7))
    - Note: Arrested development once in words, cannot change. But obviously, different thoughts cannot map to the same set of words! Why does not change originate within the word-less thought to instantiate in new words?
- As soon as a thought has found words it no longer exists in us or is serious in its deepest sense.
  When it begins to exist for others it ceases to live in us; just as a child frees itself from its mother when it comes into existence. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr3swnkxt6fqxjb6kj0bhzz3))
    - Note: This I agree with. Interpretation is hierarchical, every layer consolidates information from the previous (lossiness is mutation?). What is the form of pure thought? How can this be distinguished from nothingness, or the flotsam of the brain, etc?
- Style is the physiognomy of the mind. It is a more reliable key to character than the physiognomy of the body. To imitate another person’s style is like wearing a mask. However fine the mask, it soon becomes insipid and intolerable because it is without life; so that even the ugliest living face is better. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr67pmtvbacbt3530541gvsk))
    - Note: Style as facial expression (physiognomy = facial features, particularly ethnic). Later, he says language is the physiognomy of the nation (assumes strong national identity, rather than other community -- online communities now might be stronger than patriotic influence).
- His style is an exact expression of how he has thought, of the essential state and general quality of his thoughts. It shows the formal nature — which must always remain the same — of all the thoughts of a man, whatever the subject on which he has thought or what it is he has said about it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr67wa3f5a2rqnqe8cme146q))
    - Note: Seems to contradict each other. Isn't formal expression derived from the "pure" thought? What is meant by formal here, aside from rules-based?
- This instantly necessitates his giving up all idea of being naïve, a privilege which belongs to superior minds sensible of their superiority, and therefore sure of themselves. For instance, it is absolutely impossible for men of ordinary intelligence to make up their minds to write as they think; they resent the idea of their work looking too simple. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr67yqd409rdfv1knjg4db44))
    - Note: Only the great can be un-self conscious; masking insecurities requires development of insecurities.
- This is why simplicity has always been looked upon as a token, not only of truth, but also of genius. Style receives its beauty from the thought expressed, while with those writers who only pretend to think it is their thoughts that are said to be fine because of their style. Style is merely the silhouette of thought; ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr6jehrbdh3athnggyrqv6kq))
- Even if his fundamental idea is wrong, yet in such a case it will be clearly thought out and well pondered; in other words, it is at least formally correct, and the writing is always of some value. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr6kjbyprf3wc18eqp8yxhmk))
    - Note: Interesting!
- stile empesé ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr6kqdrjj96783j7kjh64zkt))
    - Note: "Starched style"
- tiré à quatre épingles ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr6ktftt35tvtb141xdk5dv1))
    - Note: "Dressed to the nines."

- plerumque accidit ut faciliora sint ad intelligendum et lucidiora multo, quae a doctissimo quoque dicuntur… . Erit ergo etiam obscurior, quo quisque deterior. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hraag8esvzht56veb09gs9sm))
    - Note: Google Translate: "it usually happens that they are easier to understand and much clearer, which are also said by the most learned... Therefore it will be even darker, the worse each one is."
- l’adjectif est l’ennemi du substantif. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hraajr3pe481w347n3n8f2j8))
    - Note: Google Translate: "the adjective is the enemy of the noun." Nice!
- A writer must be sparing with the reader’s time, concentration, and patience; in this way he makes him believe that what he has before him is worth his careful reading, and will repay the trouble he has spent upon it. It is always better to leave out something that is good than to write down something that is not worth saying. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hraamctcjx5dgsp94xrc9ap7))
- Therefore, if possible, the quintessence only! the chief matter only! nothing that the reader would think for himself. The use of many words in order to express little thought is everywhere the infallible sign of mediocrity; while to clothe much thought in a few words is the infallible sign of distinguished minds. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hraanns4g3gf2202m27ntm6e))
    - Note: Aphorism after aphorism in this paragraph.
- An author should guard against using all unnecessary rhetorical adornment, all useless amplification, and in general, just as in architecture he should guard against an excess of decoration, all superfluity of expression — in other words, he must aim at chastity of style. Everything that is redundant has a harmful effect. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrab8d14gpjtqcptnf48v93w))
    - Note: Style of writing mathematically! Worth reading for its content; is everything done for its own sake a waste of time? The natural conclusion is then that knowledge for its own sake is a waste as well...why read in the first place? Why gain anything?
- By subjectivity I mean when a writer thinks it sufficient for himself to know what he means and wants to say, and it is left to the reader to discover what is meant ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrabbtk1h99g2d1e1gqfvqpk))
- whereas it should be a dialogue, and, moreover, a dialogue in which he must express himself all the more clearly as the questions of the reader cannot be heard. And it is for this very reason that style should not be subjective but objective, and for it to be objective the words must be written in such a way as to directly compel the reader to think precisely the same as the author thought. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrabcprrhgf44arjtgpbzd25))
    - Note: There will always be information lost, compression, when writing. This is a futile project! -- and again, particularly relevant to mathematics.
