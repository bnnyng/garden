# Highlights
- Philosophy is an abstract field of argument and theory: this is true as much of ethics as it is of metaphysics. Why should reflection in this vein—ruthless, complex, conceptual—make us happier, more well-adjusted people? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqq6mnkjkn93965dbj5k7cx1))
- [According to the literary critic Beth Blum](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/pmla/article/abs/selfhelp-hermeneutic-its-global-history-and-literary-future/CBB376E643124A18E54789A409BFB961), “self-help is widely understood as a technology of neoliberal self-governance used to discipline citizens and manage populations”: the social function of self-help is to obfuscate injustice, directing us to work not on society but ourselves.

- “a region that from time immemorial was regarded as the true field of philosophy”—in the words of Theodor Adorno, no admirer of dumbing down or cashing in—“but which … has lapsed into intellectual neglect, sententious whimsy and finally oblivion: the teaching of the good life”?

- Plato and Aristotle, [disagreed](https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/06/western-philosophy-plato-athens-diogenes-cynic-books/674368/): they argued that philosophy as a whole, including its more esoteric parts—like metaphysics—lies at the heart of the best human life. This idea was common ground among the Hellenistic schools, the Stoics, Skeptics and Epicureans who shaped philosophy in ancient Rome.2 They promised a life of tranquility to those who grasp reality as it is.

- For Aristotle, the nature you should perfect is not your individual potential, but an objective human nature whose ideal expression lies in theoretical contemplation of the cosmos. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqq6tk8w6ybjxchyajshvrf0))
    - Note: Distortions by contemporary self help writers.
- Like Iris Murdoch, I believe that “an unexamined life can be virtuous.” But Murdoch was surely right that the question “How can we make ourselves better?” is one “that moral philosophers should attempt to answer. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqq6vjnnvkn4z7q4an4bnsef))
- According to this dictum, a moral philosopher is not a moralist who guides us to virtue but a scientist who dissects what virtue is. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqq6z0628w778cwhe9jmk7hy))
- In applied tradition the focal questions concern how a person can embrace a comprehensive life goal, like enlightenment (Buddhists), sagehood (Confucians), freedom (Kantians), authenticity (existentialists), or flourishing (Aristotelians). Like applied ethics, applied tradition has its characteristic method: the philosopher takes a question where there are moral and practical stakes particularly with respect to the life goal, identifies ideas and practices within a tradition that might answer the question, and then develops a plan for implementing those ideas and practices within the seeker’s life.

- There is little acknowledgment that a central element of most every outlook in the book is that it alone is true and every other outlook false. What we get in place of argument is appeal to personal style ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqq77mw05dp6gb3cjkg7zyrs))
- In a passage that would shock Aristotle, Daniel Kaufman, whose “preferred philosophy of life [is] Aristotelianism,” buys wholesale the metaphor of clothes: “It is not enough, then, that one admire a philosophy for its intellectual qualities. It must be well suited to the type of person one is and the type of life one leads, an ill-fitting philosophy being even more obvious and awkward and ultimately useless than an ill-fitting suit.” But Aristotle believed that his philosophy was *true*—one size fits all—not a good look for some that others need not sport.

    - Note: Funny distinction! Where have I heard of Kaufman before?
- Moral philosophy often works this way: the role of argument is not to compel assent—it almost never does—but to build conceptual schemes and through connection create new meaning. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqq7s3nh1bm9v31hndjmrk14))

- In this broader sense, self-help was entwined with philosophy at the birth of the Western tradition ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hv8nsmrqzthmgwevaq7sghe6))
