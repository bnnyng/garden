- [According to the literary critic Beth Blum](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/pmla/article/abs/selfhelp-hermeneutic-its-global-history-and-literary-future/CBB376E643124A18E54789A409BFB961), “self-help is widely understood as a technology of neoliberal self-governance used to discipline citizens and manage populations”: the social function of self-help is to obfuscate injustice, directing us to work not on society but ourselves.

- In applied tradition the focal questions concern how a person can embrace a comprehensive life goal, like enlightenment (Buddhists), sagehood (Confucians), freedom (Kantians), authenticity (existentialists), or flourishing (Aristotelians). Like applied ethics, applied tradition has its characteristic method: the philosopher takes a question where there are moral and practical stakes particularly with respect to the life goal, identifies ideas and practices within a tradition that might answer the question, and then develops a plan for implementing those ideas and practices within the seeker’s life.
