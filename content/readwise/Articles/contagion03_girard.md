# Highlights
- 2 René Girard
  our collective imaginations. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htewg7kj0rqfwnq1n3yxxt53))
    - Note: Desiring to be thin is a form of mimesis, I.e. something we only want because others desire it. A form of prestige as well.
- It is the intellectual beauty of our eating disorders at this point in our
  history that they make manifest the bankruptcy of all the theories that continue to dominate our universities. The problem is not that these eating disorders are too complex for our current systems of interpretation—which would make our explicators salivate with delight. The problem is that they are too simple, too readily intelligible. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htex77nbd8xr2wybbtv8j6yd))
- now the spirit of unnatural thinness possesses them so completely that the notion of demonic possession suits their case better than the vocabulary of modern psychiatry ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htex9py7vk9xaa9azc3dfm6p))
- If they, themselves, voluntarily recreate the worst aspects of hell in their leisure time, with no outside compulsion, they unwittingly demonstrate the realism they imprudently question. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htexhs02ncwr9mnjbhm1swqh))
    - Note: How does this tie into the topic?
- We live at a time when the healthiest and the unhealthiest actions can
  have the same motivation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htexggp00tavngam0maqbtn0))
    - Note: Society accommodates more extremes now, vs. moderation.
- we can no longer
  blame the favorite institutional scapegoats ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htexp14ewbp3frm94wjdesvj))
    - Note: In Girard's theory, scapegoat provides an outlet for mimetic violence. Why are the old scapegoats failing—"no one believes"?
