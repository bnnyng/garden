# Highlights
- to the extent that we rely on automation in certain ways, we will no longer have certain kinds of mathematical experiences associated with impasse, error, and aboutness. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j05g8p3gs2yy0hy2m899db2c))
- value-relevant properties (“centrality”) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j05gbqt30x4njfja0pg4m60g))
    - Note: Linkage with other questions of importance.
- Harris’s book can transmit the correct beliefs about the value of the Langlands program, but not the necessary
  understanding of those values. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j05ge2hs1e82xprmkjbnx0cs))
- rather than asking the (some- what nonsensical) question “how much would it matter if such-and-such a theorem, known to be true, was actually false”, they can use their experiences of impasse and resolution as guides for which theorems to value. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j05ghrd731krg5227d09edza))
    - Note: More important theorems are resolutions to problems that create greater impasse.
