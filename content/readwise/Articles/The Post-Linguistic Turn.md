## Highlights
- And, while it may at times have descended into useless technicality, the reconstituted discipline succeeded in defining an expertise and constraining thinkers methodologically from sheer flights of fancy (to some extent). ‘All genuine problems are at least theoretically capable of being solved,’ said the positivist philosopher A J Ayer in 1936.

- Such a metaphysical pseudo-proposition as “the Absolute enters into, but is itself incapable of, evolution and progress”,’ he thought, had ‘no literal significance’, even for the person who uttered it, because it could not possibly be verified by observation or experiment. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0nzjrh546x0wm5q73wfttvb))
- And Ayer was saying that, if philosophy was to have any respectable, useful or well-defined subject matter, it would be found in the nature and function of language, not the nature and function of reality. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0nzkt6knmn2aqwzp8ftsf7x))
- Countless philosophical problems, Goodman and others argued, had been manufactured by the alleged distinction between the world and our ways of describing it. We could make do with the latter, they thought, or really we had no choice until we could leave our own minds ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0nzwcnwm0qjetz6d3maydd4))
- The word ‘hermeneutics’ originally referred to the discipline of textual interpretation, especially of the Bible, and late 20th-century continental philosophy hinted that it should be philosophy’s successor. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0p045cydp1se2tpmba34emt))
- A lot of the literature of the 20th century played with ambiguity, surrealism, obscurity: if the world and we are texts, maybe we are more like modernist poetry than like classical drama, more like a novel by James Joyce than one by Jane Austen. Maybe we are trapped in a situation that we can’t get far enough outside of even to see. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0p0723bdhh9f9tt0aa8mfdm))
- Narrative theory in psychology, history, and ethics – among other applications – centralised one particular linguistic mode, storytelling, as central to the construction of personality, culture and reality, and as central as well as to value theory. ‘Life itself [is] a cloth woven of stories told,’ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0p08n6w1xe4cc63j89yds8n))
- It [explained](https://aeon.co/essays/why-story-is-used-to-explain-symphonies-and-sport-matches-alike) simultaneously the nature of human identity and the nature of the world we inhabit together, rather as ‘God’ or ‘nature’ had done for previous thinkers. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h0p09z9canhb5g8fb5qegev2))
- Any philosophy that seemed to undermine the reality of the natural world, or make it a malleable human artefact, has come to feel potentially destructive. Indeed, scholars’ obsession with linguistic interpretation, their notion that everyone has always experienced the world as though reading a book, came to seem at a certain point to be an artefact of privilege, as well as fundamentally implausible.

- Analysts held that continental philosophy was not philosophy at all, but meaningless yet relativistic babble, something of substantially less than no value. Continentalists characterised analytic philosophy as useless punctilious logic-chopping and scientism for its own sake, with no possibility of cultural critique or even meaningful connection to human life as it is actually conducted. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hm0wxj53b6fthdx03y3w76zn))
- Turning from the direction of all history or the nature of all Being itself, 20th-century philosophers tended to focus on the meaning of phrases like ‘the nature of all Being itself’. When they did, many concluded that such phrases were without significance, or were being terribly misused, and that philosophy would be better off trying to clarify the nature of language, which seemed quite a bit more likely to pay off ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hm0wyzznm2fzs8e9e3ksc1qk))
- Its basic thrust, as articulated by Russell and G E Moore early in the century, was to address and eliminate philosophical problems by analysing the language in which they were couched, a strategy that both men felt was crystallised in their student/colleague [Ludwig Wittgenstein](https://aeon.co/essays/atheists-vs-religious-belief-with-wittgenstein-on-the-stand)’s *Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus* (1921)*.* The project of that fundamental turning-point was to [clarify the limits](https://aeon.co/videos/for-ludwig-wittgenstein-language-is-a-game-but-not-a-frivolous-one) of meaningful language ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hm0xk0nrapgcdpxpyt7ntm0c))
- All genuine problems are at least theoretically capable of being solved,’ said the positivist philosopher A J Ayer in 1936. But most philosophical problems, he thought, were pseudo-problems, to be dissolved by close examination of the language in which they were couched ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hm0xmk2ktdhnbst2pvmqpj29))

- I shall mean by ‘linguistic philosophy’ the view that philosophical problems are problems which may be solved (or dissolved) either by reforming language, or by understanding more about the language we presently use ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hm10704jszzkgkv8p64spr2g))
- Here is his definition of the human:
  > Man shows himself as the entity which talks. This does not signify that the possibility of vocal utterance is peculiar to him, but rather that he is the entity which is such as to discover the world and [himself]. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hm11ec0jnsvyp6tp5sp94pf0))
