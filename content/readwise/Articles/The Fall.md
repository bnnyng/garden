# Highlights
- “Do you want a good clean life? Like everybody else?” You say yes, of course. How can one say no? “O.K. You’ll be cleaned up. Here’s a job, a family, and organized leisure activities.” And the little teeth attack the flesh, right down to the bone. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz61b03t4na2ebf0c4vkbs7y))
    - Note: Who in particular is this "organization"? From whence?
- I admire that diligence, that methodical patience! When one has no character one has to apply a method. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz61vc25y6n3qsegh9a78wwp))
- Have you noticed that Amsterdam’s concentric canals resemble the circles of hell? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz628tgvk58ya2rde8twxfdx))
- Here, we are in the last circle. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz62b3k3eke1g9wrxrcmp4b2))
    - Note: Ninth circle is treachery.
- But you can already imagine my satisfaction. I enjoyed my own nature to the fullest, and we all know that there lies happiness, although, to soothe one another mutually, we occasionally pretend to condemn such joys as selfishness. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz62kggzbwgqezm3eqm7pzt7))
    - Note: Is there such a thing as true altruism debate.
- I was made to have a body. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz62xh298jps2n1fcjdpedre))
    - Note: What a powerful phrase. Few can say this! So many implications...
- This, after all, was a result of my modesty. I refused to attribute that success to my own merits and could not believe that the conjunction in a single person of such different and such extreme virtues was the result of chance alone. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz63apq5mpavghgx0p9y0pxq))
    - Note: Funny convolution! Is there such a thing as deserving what happens to us?
- I have learned to be satisfied with understanding. It is found more readily and, besides, it’s not binding. “I beg you to believe in my sympathetic understanding” in the inner discourse always precedes immediately “and now, let’s turn to other matters.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz63hm4wex3f0nhrjvky1xrc))
    - Note: Is this somehow meant to be less desirable, a worse option? Understanding seems to be a greater need!
- he can’t love without self-love. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz63p4253t6vp3vnx3dpkx74))
    - Note: Uncontrollable self mythology. Is it not possible to be genuinely abject and love? Simone Weil, etc.
- Something must happen—and that explains most human commitments. Something must happen, even loveless slavery, even war or death. Hurray then for funerals! ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz63wj2bzxb9ve7rprw0rm3j))
- If pimps and thieves were invariably sentenced, all decent people would get to thinking they themselves were constantly innocent, cher monsieur. And in my opinion—all right, all right, I’m coming!—that’s what must be avoided above all. Otherwise, everything would be just a joke. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz6426yxebsc7kcxq6dx3cx8))
    - Note: What does this mean? Why keep everyone on their toes? Being in flux...
- It seemed to me that I was half unlearning what I had never learned and yet knew so well—how to live. Yes, I think it was probably then that everything began. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz641qjvp8k5vbcntvgsxxw3))
- Every man needs slaves as he needs fresh air. Commanding is breathing ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz66g4xsvpsvme1axnbz000c))
- The essential thing, after all, is being able to get angry with someone who has no right to talk back. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz66fzx9y2v049hp8wz7bjj9))
- “One doesn’t talk back to one’s father”—you know the expression? In one way it is very odd. To whom should one talk back in this world if not to what one loves? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz66gj9webscmg2b9edc3x9r))
- Orientals when they are silent and in the presence of whites often look scornful. Naturally they keep that look when serving. How then can you enjoy the glazed chicken? And, above all, how can you look at them and think you are right? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz66k1k794jxjqmj9030wg5s))
- I was always bursting with vanity. I, I, I is the refrain of my whole life, which could be heard in everything I said. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz66nr62f3006n12a7krvd2z))
- I wasn’t good enough to forgive offenses, but eventually I always forgot them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz66r13mmnzhkny71178vz7n))
- The same infirmity that often made me indifferent or ungrateful in such cases made me magnanimous. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz66r8bxbb5mcm2033v6dx7t))
    - Note: Does anything outside action matter in these beneficial cases?
- It is not true, after all, that I never loved. I conceived at least one great love in my life, of which I was always the object. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz673qa16rmhsng1zpjet2xw))
- Believe me, for certain men at least, not taking what one doesn’t desire is the hardest thing in the world. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz67mp05rz4rxsfn7ywck6kb))
- for me to live happily it was essential for the creatures I chose not to live at all. They must receive their life, sporadically, only at my bidding. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz68baxzses9de3gprf9t1hb))
- . In order to cease being a doubtful case, one has to cease being, that’s all. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz6a3cf2qp3re4kckbechqfd))
- Doubtless they suspected me of living fully, given up completely to happiness; and that cannot be forgiven. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz6b2czy4sm865eg57wwr2ja))

- Spitefulness is the only possible ostentation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz6d3xt63341gp3bxqae4fwx))
    - Note: What does this mean?
- We are all exceptional cases. We all want to appeal against something! Each of us insists on being innocent at all cost, even if he has to accuse the whole human race and heaven itself. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz6d11k2a3k90a9071bqw79h))
- Wealth, cher ami, is not quite acquittal, but reprieve, and that’s always worth taking. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz6d66egch4bvrb6kgq8k66w))
- How could sincerity be a condition of friendship? A liking for truth at any cost is a passion that spares nothing and that nothing resists. It’s a vice, at times a comfort, or a selfishness. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz6em9phzfqgg0n8f5z70dtf))
- Not enough cynicism and not enough virtue. We lack the energy of evil as well as the energy of good. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz6epr69fqc1k5vg7enqe007))

- I have never been really able to believe that human affairs were serious matters. I had no idea where the serious might lie, except that it was not in all this I saw around me—which seemed to me merely an amusing game, or tiresome. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz6mzg9sv9wt90me3dc4yk9f))
    - Note: Unfortunately, very "real" and relatable thought. I see how this gets into a vicious, unpleasant mindset though, makes me uncomfortable. On the other hand, can be soothing to keep in mind?
- I was absent at the moment when I took up the most space. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz6n9hnmcz18jr4wkmc5yaen))
- In both cases there was a rule of the game, which was not serious but which we enjoyed taking as if it were. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz6na77g8dnh1zfqr4xz91xw))
- the only places in the world where I feel innocent. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz6naf7fw6kpa77mvdcyvj6t))

- living among men without sharing their interests, I could not manage to believe in the commitments I made. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz9qq0cb52gn9cg7gane15ck))
- That absolute murder of a truth used to make me dizzy. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz9qrmpjwjbt101sxqzfhnz0))
    - Note: Why change? Some kind of internal consistency or security?
- But have I not let deserving creatures die? Maybe. And maybe I am ready to do so again. Whereas this man—just look at him—will not do so again. He is still quite amazed to have accomplished what he has.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz9r2vz867z874fg54rdqcn9))
- For more than thirty years I had been in love exclusively with myself. What hope was there of losing such a habit? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz9rhqzr7wjfd10b2dr78ccz))
- Because I longed for eternal life, I went to bed with harlots and drank for nights on end. In the morning, to be sure, my mouth was filled with the bitter taste of the mortal state. But, for hours on end, I had soared in bliss. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz9rkyfk9g9rac4e4r3ss8qz))
    - Note: Hedonism is an escape and numbing to one's mortality, identity, history.
- One plays at being immortal and after a few weeks one doesn’t even know whether or not one can hang on till the next day. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz9rtm6q6edhvgh4hvgan83t))
- There is nothing frenzied about debauchery, contrary to what is thought. It is but a long sleep. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz9rvaypec68vx3dh764ggzv))
- Moreover, we cannot assert the innocence of anyone, whereas we can state with certainty the guilt of all. Every man testifies to the crime of all the others ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz9s51s3s42dzgezbvmw4kcj))
    - Note: What? Very evocative torture method! What does it mean for his reasoning to collapse?
- There are always reasons for murdering a man. On the contrary, it is impossible to justify his living. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz9s89g2w79x75m5ysf5hqjv))
    - Note: Falsifiable, innocence is true because of no evidence to the otherwise.
- since we are all judges, we are all guilty before one another, all Christs in our mean manner, one by one crucified, always without knowing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzcv3agnqg39cn7wr6vyapgt))
- And don’t all my stories, true or false, tend toward the same conclusion? Don’t they all have the same meaning? So what does it matter whether they are true or false if, in both cases, they are significant of what I have been and of what I am? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz9w43xf6gjc8p0srdd0zcmr))
- Truth, like light, blinds. Falsehood, on the contrary, is a beautiful twilight that enhances every object. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz9w49ak130p05m02vs8vxmj))
- Besides, these Dutch beds, so hard and with their immaculate sheets—one dies in them as if already wrapped in a shroud, embalmed in purity. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz9whaz10863eyf28d5qrm43))
    - Note: lol?
- A hundred and fifty years ago, people became sentimental about lakes and forests. Today we have the lyricism of the prison cell. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz9wnvtak63xgw65ct9fgyhj))
    - Note: What tugs on humanity as a trait, invokes human emotion. And what about in the 21st century? Do we experience anything for ourselves?
- Without slavery, as a matter of fact, there is no definitive solution. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz9x90kb7vhsfpfhb66kke8e))
- At breakfast I used to spread it on my toast, I used to chew it all day long, and in company my breath was delightfully redolent of freedom. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz9x99newg0qmxawatwx67d3))
- At the end of all freedom is a court sentence; that’s why freedom is too heavy to bear, especially when you’re down with a fever, or are distressed, or love nobody. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz9xb3kdmk28c00ft0bda45c))
    - Note: Freedom is to lack excuse, be judged to the fullest?
- Inasmuch as one couldn’t condemn others without immediately judging oneself, one had to overwhelm oneself to have the right to judge others. Inasmuch as every judge some day ends up as a penitent, one had to travel the road in the opposite direction and practice the profession of penitent to be able to end up as a judge. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz9zg27c6x75m6zvd2y0d0ps))
- I am like them, to be sure; we are in the soup together. However, I have a superiority in that I know it and this gives me the right to speak. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz9zk2e2pesy76ntsgzfczdv))
- (for the fall occurs at dawn) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz9zpm5w0d5gzfn61dr05hnw))
