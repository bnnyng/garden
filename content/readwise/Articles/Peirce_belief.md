# Highlights
- The object of reasoning is to find out, from the consideration of what we already know, something else which we do not know ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htx64ar62773nh21m2a576hx))
- Logicality in regard to practical matters (if this be understood, not in the old sense, but as consisting in a wise union of security with fruitfulness of reasoning) is the most useful quality an animal can possess, and might, therefore, result from the action of natural selection ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htx66sc96hm22cyfpkbzdexc))
    - Note: What is logicality? Use of formalisms? // I disagree, heuristics and core knowledge are what enable survival type decision making. // Heuristics mentioned in the following paragraph on habit, which is both intrinsic and learned. In this case feels trivially true. Also maybe just talking about conscious behavior.
- an inference is regarded as valid or not, without reference to the truth or falsity of its
  conclusion specially, but according as the habit which determines it is such as to produce true conclusions in general or not ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htx6dred4n4m9efj6hgnyth8))
- there exists a division among facts, such that in one class are all those which are absolutely essential as guiding principles, while in the others are all which have any other interest as objects of research ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htx6jz4k79g0sjk9npv6wpfc))
    - Note: Meta disciplines
- common-sense, or thought as it first emerges above the level of the narrowly practical, is deeply imbued with that bad logical quality to which the epithet *metaphysical* is commonly
  applied; and nothing can clear it up but a severe course of logic. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htx6pa2yjk3f356b29a5vf5h))
    - Note: Common sense is carefully constructed? Don’t quite believe.
- The irritation of doubt causes a struggle to attain a state of belief. I shall term this struggle *inquiry* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htx6we82kjt3nary58fa4q9w))
- With the doubt, therefore, the struggle begins, and with the cessation of doubt it ends. Hence, the sole object of inquiry is the settlement of opinion. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htx6svzygx186rzvhcnybpp2))
- an inquiry, to have that completely satisfactory result called demonstration, has only to start with propositions perfectly free from all actual doubt. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htx6xmk8ss6cz4k360nedgzc))
    - Note: Content of axioms does not matter, but some content more believable?
- the instinctive dislike of an undecided state of mind, exaggerated into a vague dread of doubt, makes men cling spasmodically to the views they already take ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htx72v5h4f2xdma6wzq0wbbe))
- A man may go through life, systematically keeping out of view all that might cause a change in his opinions, and if he only succeeds—basing his method, as he does, on two fundamental psychological laws—I do not see what can be said against his doing so. It would be an egotistical impertinence to object that his procedure is irrational, for that only amounts to saying that his method of settling belief is not ours. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htx74t5t747hx65tpj803cyp))
    - Note: HOW people arrive at ostensibly false beliefs. Minimizing discomfort is itself rational?
- But this method of fixing belief, which may be called the method of tenacity, will be unable to hold its ground in practice. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htx7ak7yqqq0z4rx072z39wb))
    - Note: Even those on fringes who claim truth only survive because of insular communities
- This conception, that another man’s thought or sentiment may be equivalent to one’s own, is a distinctly new step, and a highly important one ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htx7aasnj0x4f82crranmeg8))
- the problem becomes how to fix belief, not in the individual merely, but in the community. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htx79wb2d0bcyss7zhk7g92d))
- the officer of a society does not feel justified in surrendering the interests of that society for the sake of mercy, as he might his own private interests. It is natural, therefore, that sympathy and fellowship should thus produce a most ruthless power. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htx7e442nd3750jrbyb55q5s))
- In judging this method of fixing belief, which may be called the method of authority, we must, in the first place, allow its immeasurable mental and moral superiority to the method of tenacity ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htx7escjpjqbs72bc8mk04zw))
- The willful adherence to a belief, and the arbitrary forcing of it upon others, must, therefore, both be given up ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htx7gsfnmk6cxz097ep7hw0a))
    - Note: W David Marx, all culture is arbitrary
- Let the action of natural preferences be unimpeded, then, and under their influence let men, conversing together and regarding matters in different lights, gradually develop beliefs in harmony with natural causes. This method resembles that by which conceptions of art have been brought to maturity ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htx7kc02t1fhcb7114d0pg9h))
- They have been chiefly adopted because their fundamental propositions seemed “agreeable to reason. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htx7kkbctbjy4gbftjsc6f7d))
- It makes of inquiry something similar to the development of taste ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htx7ma654rm2chvchndfe6qw))
- it is necessary that a method should be found by which
  our beliefs may be determined by nothing human, but by some external permanency—by something upon which our thinking has no effect ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htx7nzxjy6tqpwhg1hv7s83m))
- the conception of truth as something public is not yet developed ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htx7pfr031x3n91qw4vvm0ns))
    - Note: Note: truth is public!
- There are Real things, whose characters are entirely independent of our opinions about them; those Reals affect our senses according to regular laws, and, though our sensations are as different as are our relations to the objects, yet, by taking advantage of the laws of perception, we can ascertain by reasoning how things really and truly are; and any man, if he have sufficient experience and he reason enough about it, will be led to the one True conclusion. The new conception here involved is that of Reality ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htx7qzfs0bw7400f19s1n0b3))
- No doubts of the method, therefore, necessarily arise from its practice, as is the case with all the others. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htx7th5evp8qjxjfpxhdtvp1))
- This is the only one of the four methods which presents any distinction of a right and a wrong way. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htx7st8dqcmcb9200drskf5b))
- he should consider that, after all, he wishes his opinions to coincide with the fact, and that there is no reason why the results of those three first methods should do so. To bring about this effect is the prerogative of the method of science ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htx8cv869ra3dwkvxqdbh4mw))
