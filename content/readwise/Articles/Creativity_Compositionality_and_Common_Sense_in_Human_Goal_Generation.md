# Highlights
- Chu and Schulz (2020b) characterize these types of play as creating and solving arbitrary and unusual problems, hypothesizing such play aids in generating new ideas and exploring novel search spaces. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq96aw1pvdgn57k1b1yagjz2))
- We constructed our DSL using an empirical, bottom-up approach: we studied the games participants created, and designed a representation that captured as much as possible of the semantics of games in our dataset ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq96dbefyz4zzz14gh0nw7fs))
