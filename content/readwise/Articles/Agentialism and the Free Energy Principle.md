# Highlights
- The free energy principle rests on sparse coupling, that is, the idea that “things” can be defined in terms of the absence of direct influence between subsets of a system. Subsets of the system, are the things, if they exhibit certain properties ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkhcen03b618vgvr9318335w))
- He said that, the free energy principle tells us something deep about **what it means for things to be coupled to each other, but also distinct from one another**. It implies that any thing which exists physically—in the sense that it can be reliably re-identified over time as “the same thing,” will necessarily look as if it “tracks” the things to which it is coupled ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkhcfh5qa06fyfxc4p2xfhdc))
- Abductive inference, often referred to as **inference to the best explanation**, is a form of reasoning that starts with an observation and then seeks out or **disambiguates** the simplest and most likely explanation for it. It differs from deductive and inductive reasoning by focusing on generating and filtering hypotheses which could plausibly account for the observed data, rather than proving something with certainty (deduction) or predicting future instances based on past occurrences (induction). It's a kind of logical reasoning that brings us to a provisional, best-guess conclusion based on the evidence at hand ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkhckf13g4wagaypa4bhhhfx))
- Maxwell is emphasising the idea that systems appear to engage in a process that looks like they're making inferences about their environment ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkhcm9fmphwrw8xcg61mn440))
- generative models—internal representations of how they think the world works ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkhcx80zq5nz479k7t7gtm0r))
- active inference, which models systems **as if** they were a superposition of agents trying to figure out the most likely state of the world given their perception, and behaving in ways that would reduce their uncertainty or surprise ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkhd0vafg294m3m1e3hbwtdt))
- > Dynamics are simply formal descriptions of behavior.
  Mechanics are mathematical theories that are developed to explain the functional form or “shape” of said dynamics, which is to say they explain **why the dynamics are the way that we observe them to be** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkhd1edt7fxx2tzkgh6dsvk4))
- **anti-reductionism" -** he appears to be aligning with a materialist view that recognises and seeks to account for the complex structures and behaviours of systems at all levels—acknowledging that these cannot simply be reduced to or fully predicted by their constituent parts ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkhf2jj5bfean8bk9nb5dmb4))
    - Note: Also known as complexity science
- Consequently, the "agent-ness" and "thing-ness" under the FEP are not necessarily disjoint concepts but rather different vantage points of an overarching framework that seeks to explain the behaviour of systems and agents in a consistent manner. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkhfsdrxt5dtt9jbpmak8tvm))
- In a more technical terms, the states of activity are parts of the system's internal dynamics that allow the system to **exert some influence on environmental states, potentially changing them.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkhfvn5z1n82fwdv7tgj61rf))
- So, active states are rooted in how various systems—adaptive or otherwise—employ their capacities to either preserve their internal structure in the face of environmental dynamism or change in response to it ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkhfwt4448j0d5vwnzhwbbn8))
    - Note: Almost tautological, pushing word definition to maximum information in literal meaning
- A system's 'agential density' might be analogised to the extent to which it actively regulates its internal states and interacts with the environment to fulfil its generative model—essentially acting upon its predictions and updating them in light of new sensory information ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkhfywzaahxtc2egqzah2yxq))
    - Note: Continuous trait, can be higher or lower.
- The interesting part is that **these virtual agents can influence and diffuse the behaviour and agency of the physical agents via top-down causation**. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkhg42t183a7pg65gq3bvx38))
    - Note: What is the point of thinking of these as agents? How improves understanding of the world?
- This distributed nature of computation implies that the cognitive load of planning is not solely borne by individual agents. Rather, it is a collective process that emerges from the dynamic interplay of various elements within the system ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkhgcg273wsk5m4gvyveza4j))
- Humans going about their daily lives have access to rich, diverse sources of entropy and help preserve it. **To create any divergent and creative process in AI, you probably need to farm entropy from humans** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkhgf81nsacr69xqzq9vw2sz))
    - Note: Interesting—always a statistical process? Not sure how to phrase this.
- Systems are considered to have generative models—**internal representations** of how they think the world works—and they update these models based on sensory input in a way that is consistent with Bayesian updating ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkhgk86b18sq8tbqw4sqmkzb))
