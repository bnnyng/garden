## Highlights
- As William James wrote at the dawn of experimental psychology, “Everyone knows what attention is. It is the taking possession by the mind, in clear, and vivid form, of one out of what seems several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thought.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7zdk3vqt4k54fv6smhbadyx))
    - Note: Many different operational definitions!
- Attention is certainly far from a clear or unified concept. Yet despite its many, vague, and sometimes conflicting definitions, there is a core quality of attention that is demonstrably of high importance to information processing in the brain and, increasingly, artificial systems. Attention is the flexible control of limited computational resources. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7zdr49r1k7h3y05b3w1e5er))

- In its most generic form, attention could be described as merely an overall level of alertness or ability to engage with surroundings. In this way it interacts with arousal and the sleep-wake spectrum. Vigilance in psychology refers to the ability to sustain attention and is therefore related as well.

    - Note: Biologically entrenched definition of attention -- related to sleep/wake cycles (circadian rhythm? super cool biological phenomenons), sleep deprivation, and sedatives (what about stimulants?).
- Saccades are small and rapid eye movements made several times each second. As the fovea offers the highest visual resolution on the retina, choosing where to place it is essentially a choice about where to deploy limited computational resources. In this way, eye movements indicate the locus of attention. As this shift of attention is outwardly visible it is known as overt visual attention.

- Image regions that attract attention are considered “salient” and are computed in a “bottom-up” fashion. That is, they don't require conscious or effortful processing to identify and are likely the result of built-in feature detectors in the visual system.

    - Note: Is this the primary evidence for physical specialization? Not even conscious processing -- when we attempt to model attention, are we ever modeling a conscious process?
- When subjects need to make multiple saccades in a row they tend not to return to locations they have recently attended and may be slow to respond if something relevant occurs there. This phenomenon is known as inhibition of return ([Itti and Koch, 2001](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00029/full#B70)).

- Covert spatial attention is selective in the sense that certain regions are selected for further processing at the expense of others. This has been referred to as the “spotlight” of attention. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7zek0fxeaj9mqv0za5964hc))

    - Note: Feature-based attention? Do models currently account for this (there is a clear physical basis for why this happens biologically), and is there a reason to?
- Importantly, for covert—as opposed to overt—attention the input to the visual system can be identical while the processing of that input is flexibly selective. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7zenhmj8yxjdv4k55xpamad))

- In some theories of attention, covert spatial attention exists to help guide overt attention. Particularly, the pre-motor theory of attention posits that the same neural circuits plan saccades and control covert spatial attention ([Rizzolatti et al., 1987](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00029/full#B126)). The frontal eye field (FEF) is known to be involved in the control of eye movements. Stimulating the neurons in FEF at levels too low to evoke eye movements has been shown to create effects similar to covert attention ([Moore et al., 2003](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00029/full#B106)). In this way, covert attention may be a means of deciding where to overtly look. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7zes11hccb5rpmf09gjkgdh))
