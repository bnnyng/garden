# Highlights
- Literary works are pieces of rhetoric as well as reports. They demand a peculiarly vigilant kind of reading, one which is alert to tone, mood, pace, genre, syntax, grammar, texture, rhythm, narrative structure, punctuation, ambiguity – in fact to everything that comes under the heading of ‘form’. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hm3mf2ksb3at293dtte9ezsz))
- Part of what we mean by a ‘literary’ work is one in which what
  is said is to be taken in terms of how it is said. It is the kind of writing in which the content is inseparable from the language in which it is presented. Language is constitutive of the reality or experience, rather than simply a vehicle for it ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hm3mftf6g649ea9w3804a6r1))
- All reading involves a fair amount of stage setting. A lot of things must already be in place simply for a text to be intelligible. One of them is previous works of literature. Every literary work harks back, if only unconsciously, to other works ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hm3nep1m46q6kgx8bt8fhm7w))

- purple’ (excessively ornate) prose. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hm6b29sx784sh9qrh69sp6vm))
- Roughly speaking, ‘once upon a time’ is how fairy tales begin, whereas ‘In the beginning’ is how myths of origin begin. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hm6cn6ccw8ybv9ss8231znsa))
- The verbal gesture ‘Once upon a time’ pushes a fable so far off from the present into some misty mythological realm that it no longer seems to belong to human history ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hm6cmyg7syvfqnegvq962mzc))
- ‘Once upon a time’ signals to the reader not to raise certain questions, such as Is this true? Where did it happen? Was it before or after the invention of cornflakes? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hm6cn2gb5v2bygh6fyjyk7wv))
- parataxis, in which a writer strings clauses together without indicating how they are to be co-­ordinated with or subordinated to each other. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hm6crxqhrdqw15pq4r0gecy0))
- Critics are always on the hunt for ambiguities, and there is a
  notable one in the first line of an Emily Dickinson verse: ‘My life closed twice before it’s close ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hm6dksvwmtd0x8jmr55gez7x))
- In attending the funeral of an acquaintance, we are expected to feel the sentiments proper to the procedures of the ceremony itself. In a similar way, Milton’s feelings in this poem are bound up with its verbal strategies. They do not consist of some heartache that lurks behind it ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hm6ejg9593d4a3xyb68egmmw))

- What all these critical strategies have in common is their heightened sensitivity to language. Even exclamation marks may be worth a few sentences of critical comment. One might call all this the ‘micro’ aspects of literary criticism ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmdwhj3xcyrc5rse4ywx0hzn))
- a text is a transaction between itself and a reader. A book is a material object which exists even if nobody picks it up, but this is not true of a text. A text is a pattern of meaning, and patterns of meaning do not lead lives of their own, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmdwn3zz90hjn3djyecfftp3))
- A character, like a character reference today, was a sign, portrait or description of what a man or woman was like. Then, after a while, it came to mean the man or woman as such. The sign that had stood for the individual became the individual herself. The distinctiveness of the mark became the uniqueness of the person. The word ‘character’ is thus an example of the figure of speech known as synecdoche, in which a part represents the whole ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmdwrybkskhfnm391d9z8zs8))
- Pressed to an extreme, this rather curious conception of men and women suggests that a great deal, perhaps most, of what they are and do is not really them. It is not distinctive to them; and since character or personality is thought to be incomparable, it cannot count as part of it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmdwtd5p6h8ww1mrnym5vh10))
- In fact, it is almost possible to pinpoint the first moment in English history at which virtue becomes boring and vice beguiling. The philosopher Thomas Hobbes, writing in the mid-­seventeenth century, admires such heroic or aristocratic qualities as courage, honour, glory and magnanimity; the philosopher John Locke, writing at the end of the seventeenth century, champions the middle-­class values of industry, thrift, sobriety and moderation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmdx0sjkwrhrnw0tgfajqw4d))
- To try to capture the ‘essence’ of an individual, in the sense of
  what makes her peculiarly herself, is inevitably to find ourselves using generic terms. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hme2gez7xr5tfz72vd23fkk2))
- Stereotypes reduce men and women to general categories, whereas types preserve their individuality but lend it some broader context ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hme2k8sf2jj4vj3jhk098tz5))
- In fact, there is nothing that does not resemble something else in some respect. The Great Wall of China resembles the concept of heartache in that neither can peel a banana ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hme2mjeea8c9cm6hhy3d31hr))
- Only because we are born into human societies do we become individual persons ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hme2pp27tt8d04btxy4wzyft))

- We also need to examine the techniques by which character is manufactured. Is a particular literary figure presented simply as a type or emblem, or is she subtly psychologised? Is she grasped from the inside or treated from other characters’ standpoints? Is she seen as coherent or self-­contradictory, static or evolving, firmly etched or fuzzy at the edges? Are characters viewed in the round or stripped to functions of the plot? Are they defined through their actions and relationships, or do they loom up as disembodied consciousnesses? Do we feel them as vivid physical presences or essentially verbal ones, as readily knowable or as full of elusive depths? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmnjs0bkbpr61mmawp3ca366))
- The realist novel tends to grasp individual lives in terms of histories, communities, kinship and institutions. It is in these frameworks that the self is seen as embedded. J ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmnjv57xe9nyseqn4vegadn8))
- There is a difference between this realist project and the modernist novel, which quite often presents us with a single, solitary consciousness. Think, for example, of Beckett’s Malone Dies or Woolf’s Mrs Dalloway. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmnjtcw2zyxwb5zmm79jw05w))
- ‘I regard writing not as an investigation of character, but as an exercise in the use of language, and with this I am obsessed. I have no technical psychological interest. It is drama, speech and events that interest me. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmnjx7t5vwqf10g69kst37jd))

- As such, it reflects an era when identity was felt on the whole to be less problematic than it is today. People could still see themselves as the agents of their own destinies. They had a fairly acute sense of where they stopped and other people began. Their personal and collective history, for all its ups and downs, seems to represent a coherent evolution, one which was more likely to issue in felicity than in catastrophe.

## New highlights added January 22, 2024 at 12:35 AM
- Oscar Wilde, another subversive Irishman who made a career out of baiting the British, described truth as ‘one’s latest mood’. For him to be truly free meant to be free of a consistent selfhood ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmr098mqk9rr50d0mstbs2m7))
- Yet ‘intellectual’ is one of the last words to describe his writing. His poems are built out of words, images and sensations rather than ideas. In fact, he did not believe that a poet could think in his poetry at all. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmr0cryr4w4p0zcm077m7rmk))
- One might say of a good deal of modernist writing that the true protagonist is not this or that character, but language itself. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmr0exsf0xnjwq8271w3eb8s))
## New highlights added January 23, 2024 at 8:01 PM
- For Eliot, the creative imagination is the opposite of egoism. It allows us to enter into the inner lives of others, rather than remaining sealed off from them in our own private spheres. The artistic is thus very close to the ethical. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmvppm48q421xx32m9td9dxs))
- For another thing, empathy is not the only form of understanding. In fact, taken literally, it is not a form of understanding at all. If I ‘become’ you, I lose my faculty of knowing what you are like. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmvpq3r6tr9rnw3ybvhh0rkv))
- To judge involves holding something a little at arm’s length, a move which is compatible with sympathy but not with empathy. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmvpwhkd7qgacbdq85q5pndg))
- Dickens’s David Copperfield tells us that as a boy he was able to see in pieces, but not in the round. Ironically, this is the way Dickens himself tends to perceive. A child’s vision of reality may be vivid but fragmentary, and so, often enough, is Dickens’s own way of looking ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmvqqmrfqv30c4k6ctk4rq4c))
## New highlights added January 28, 2024 at 1:07 AM
- the English novel takes off at the point where everyday existence begins to seem endlessly enthralling. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn26ah57tedypsfbwjg7t9tw))
- The modern form of Providence, in other words, is known as fiction ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn26a5a33772zdx9qwztkfnk))
- ‘distribution at the last of prizes, pensions, husbands, wives, babies, millions, appended paragraphs, and cheerful remarks’ which we find in the final pages of so many realist novels. The point of such conclusions is to console, whereas the effect of many a modernist ending is to unsettle. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn26jdmdb6ddkaavc60z4y08))
- It may be helpful in this respect to think of narrative as a kind
  of strategy. Like any strategy, it mobilises certain resources and deploys certain techniques to achieve specific goals. A good many realist novels can be seen as problem-­solving devices. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn26pbghjfs1p4g6arfxcs4f))
- Whereas realism views the world as an unfolding, modernism tends to see it as a text. The word ‘text’ here is akin to ‘textile’, meaning something spun of many interwoven threads ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn26qcmaygp0f6xa9bacvy6n))
- To narrate is to falsify. In fact, one might even claim that to write is to falsify. Writing, after all, is a process which unfolds in time, and in this respect resembles narrative. The only authentic literary work, then, would be one which is conscious of this falsification, and which tries to tell its tale in a way that takes it into account ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn26tcgt9mz3mrrhs7ykvmyj))
- Narratives must find a way of suggesting that there could be many versions of their subject-­matter beside their own. If they are not to appear deceptively absolute, they must point to their own arbitrariness ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn26ty1qky9d4nmkwncgx24b))
- But it is a negative kind of freedom. We live in a world in which there is nothing that cannot be narrated, but nothing that needs to be either. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn26sv5pcpg5x1g35fj7c2xh))
- History, to adapt the words of Joyce’s Stephen Dedalus, is a nightmare from which modernism is trying to awaken. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn26wg6sf107y8wnrp2f87c4))
- Works of fiction like Tristram Shandy, Heart of Darkness, Ulysses and Mrs Dalloway can serve to free us from seeing human life as goal-­driven, logically unfolding and rigorously coherent. As such, they can help us to enjoy it more. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn274snxrq038amtpbrp9gw4))
- One of the things we mean by calling a piece of writing ‘literary’ is that it is not tied to a specific context. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn277w9c9x84brns4e1txx27))
- All literary works are orphaned at birth. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn277nmchgy1x1vbxr1e6v59))
- It is as though this fact is ‘fictionalised’ by the novel. It is put to work in a context in which its truth or falsehood is not the main point. What matters is how it behaves within the imaginative logic of the work. There is a difference between being true to the facts and being true to life. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn27crtsbqxdxcatf1hme1mc))
    - Note: Unrelated to the highlight, but I fear this book is getting more and more pedantic. Something about reading it feels like I’m getting rocked to sleep. Can’t decide if it’s pleasant or not, I guess it’s admirable to teach something that could come off really boring. This guy sure reads!
- Marcel Proust, whose prose is rarely less than lucid, can nevertheless produce sentences which stretch for half a page, full of labyrinthine alleys and syntactical byways, propelling the meaning of a passage around any number of tight grammatical corners and hairpin bends. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn27p197wyth7wt2nv16g3wf))
- When we describe a work as realist, we do not mean that it is closer to reality in some absolute way than non-realist literature. We mean that it conforms to what people of a certain time and place tend to regard as reality ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn27r13mvqnrhpndh7bjcswj))
- To say that my construal of the poem is unconvincing is to say
  that it offends the sense that we habitually make of things ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn7jq4sxvcaz7ff5yr5en3t5))
- The word midrash means to seek or investigate, and holy scripture was regarded as semantically inexhaustible ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn7jwc6hncjv3q3q0end1pvh))
- Moreover, unless a piece of scripture could be brought to bear on the needs and preoccupations of its time, it was judged to be a dead letter. It had to be given life by being looked at in the light of the contemporary moment. You did not truly understand the text unless you found a way of putting it into practice. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn7jvzcn8twq8y7m4skbvhr2))
- Some literary theorists would claim that if you happen to find this interpretation of ‘Baa Baa Black Sheep’ rewarding and thought-provoking, then that is enough reason to adopt it. Others would insist that such interpretations must be cognitive, in the sense of yielding us accurate knowledge of the work. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn7k47g4syeym0mxy6yxas2x))
- Literary works may best be seen not as texts with a fixed sense,
  but as matrices capable of generating a whole range of possible meanings. They do not so much contain meaning as produce it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn7k4qy2jr6yb4vn57b7t94s))
- If meaning is relatively determinate, it is because it is more than just a verbal affair. It signifies a compact between human beings in a specific place and time, embodying their shared ways of acting, feeling and perceiving. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn7k8pe25hq1k7wpxxmam42h))
- The same is true of literary works themselves, as I have pointed out already. They are transactions, not material objects. There is no literature without a reader. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn7kbr9qpxqwd7tdh5sezfmz))
- If readers bring assumptions to literary works, literary works can
  also intimate attitudes to their readers. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn7ksxertnxgfh1n8qjq1wnw))
- One way in which we can try to grasp a poem or novel as a whole is by investigating its themes, meaning the pattern of preoccupations we find in it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn7ktqbpgy9k0w6vf7exdsvq))
- All interpretations are partial and provisional. There is no last word. It may be worth noting, however, what this brief analysis tries to do. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn7n3qtt1y41ev2nb6a5966f))
    - Note: Excellent demonstration of analysis, convinced me!

- To be recognisable as art, a work must have some connection with what we categorise as art already, even if it ends up by transforming the category out of all recognition ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn7syjsm9jmzxc3gn87n7zzs))
- All phenomena, including all works of art, are woven out of other phenomena, so that nothing is ever quite new or ever quite the same. To steal a phrase from Joyce, postmodernism is a ‘neverchanging everchanging’ culture, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn7t4bheac8ee50kt1fjnz5j))
- Human contacts are fleeting and sporadic. People appear as enigmas to each other. So in portraying urban men and women as he does, Dickens is arguably more realistic than showing them in the round ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn7t8vywc5zj04b39pbqpw3n))

- You can enjoy books you do not admire and admire books you do not enjoy ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn7ts6wwdad9gtbmqkndem9z))
- It is surely a virtue of literature that it restores human speech to its true abundance, and in doing so recovers something of our suppressed humanity ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn7xr99hwmzqszz21235fwpm))
- It is a precious style of writing, meaning one which is affectedly elegant or over-­refined; but the passage gets away with it partly because it is mildly amusing, partly because it is ironically self-­aware, and partly because it comes through as the speaker’s rather poignant way of compensating for the somewhat sordid predicament in which he finds himself, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn98ms7g8g50b9a97mbqm5ym))
