# Highlights
- Literary works are pieces of rhetoric as well as reports. They demand a peculiarly vigilant kind of reading, one which is alert to tone, mood, pace, genre, syntax, grammar, texture, rhythm, narrative structure, punctuation, ambiguity – in fact to everything that comes under the heading of ‘form’. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hm3mf2ksb3at293dtte9ezsz))
- Part of what we mean by a ‘literary’ work is one in which what
  is said is to be taken in terms of how it is said. It is the kind of writing in which the content is inseparable from the language in which it is presented. Language is constitutive of the reality or experience, rather than simply a vehicle for it ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hm3mftf6g649ea9w3804a6r1))
- All reading involves a fair amount of stage setting. A lot of things must already be in place simply for a text to be intelligible. One of them is previous works of literature. Every literary work harks back, if only unconsciously, to other works ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hm3nep1m46q6kgx8bt8fhm7w))

- purple’ (excessively ornate) prose. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hm6b29sx784sh9qrh69sp6vm))
- Roughly speaking, ‘once upon a time’ is how fairy tales begin, whereas ‘In the beginning’ is how myths of origin begin. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hm6cn6ccw8ybv9ss8231znsa))
- The verbal gesture ‘Once upon a time’ pushes a fable so far off from the present into some misty mythological realm that it no longer seems to belong to human history ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hm6cmyg7syvfqnegvq962mzc))
- ‘Once upon a time’ signals to the reader not to raise certain questions, such as Is this true? Where did it happen? Was it before or after the invention of cornflakes? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hm6cn2gb5v2bygh6fyjyk7wv))
- parataxis, in which a writer strings clauses together without indicating how they are to be co-­ordinated with or subordinated to each other. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hm6crxqhrdqw15pq4r0gecy0))
- Critics are always on the hunt for ambiguities, and there is a
  notable one in the first line of an Emily Dickinson verse: ‘My life closed twice before it’s close ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hm6dksvwmtd0x8jmr55gez7x))
- In attending the funeral of an acquaintance, we are expected to feel the sentiments proper to the procedures of the ceremony itself. In a similar way, Milton’s feelings in this poem are bound up with its verbal strategies. They do not consist of some heartache that lurks behind it ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hm6ejg9593d4a3xyb68egmmw))

- What all these critical strategies have in common is their heightened sensitivity to language. Even exclamation marks may be worth a few sentences of critical comment. One might call all this the ‘micro’ aspects of literary criticism ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmdwhj3xcyrc5rse4ywx0hzn))
- a text is a transaction between itself and a reader. A book is a material object which exists even if nobody picks it up, but this is not true of a text. A text is a pattern of meaning, and patterns of meaning do not lead lives of their own, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmdwn3zz90hjn3djyecfftp3))
- A character, like a character reference today, was a sign, portrait or description of what a man or woman was like. Then, after a while, it came to mean the man or woman as such. The sign that had stood for the individual became the individual herself. The distinctiveness of the mark became the uniqueness of the person. The word ‘character’ is thus an example of the figure of speech known as synecdoche, in which a part represents the whole ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmdwrybkskhfnm391d9z8zs8))
- Pressed to an extreme, this rather curious conception of men and women suggests that a great deal, perhaps most, of what they are and do is not really them. It is not distinctive to them; and since character or personality is thought to be incomparable, it cannot count as part of it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmdwtd5p6h8ww1mrnym5vh10))
- In fact, it is almost possible to pinpoint the first moment in English history at which virtue becomes boring and vice beguiling. The philosopher Thomas Hobbes, writing in the mid-­seventeenth century, admires such heroic or aristocratic qualities as courage, honour, glory and magnanimity; the philosopher John Locke, writing at the end of the seventeenth century, champions the middle-­class values of industry, thrift, sobriety and moderation.

- To try to capture the ‘essence’ of an individual, in the sense of
  what makes her peculiarly herself, is inevitably to find ourselves using generic terms. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hme2gez7xr5tfz72vd23fkk2))
- Stereotypes reduce men and women to general categories, whereas types preserve their individuality but lend it some broader context ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hme2k8sf2jj4vj3jhk098tz5))
- In fact, there is nothing that does not resemble something else in some respect. The Great Wall of China resembles the concept of heartache in that neither can peel a banana ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hme2mjeea8c9cm6hhy3d31hr))
- Only because we are born into human societies do we become individual persons ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hme2pp27tt8d04btxy4wzyft))

- We also need to examine the techniques by which character is manufactured. Is a particular literary figure presented simply as a type or emblem, or is she subtly psychologised? Is she grasped from the inside or treated from other characters’ standpoints? Is she seen as coherent or self-­contradictory, static or evolving, firmly etched or fuzzy at the edges? Are characters viewed in the round or stripped to functions of the plot? Are they defined through their actions and relationships, or do they loom up as disembodied consciousnesses? Do we feel them as vivid physical presences or essentially verbal ones, as readily knowable or as full of elusive depths? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmnjs0bkbpr61mmawp3ca366))
- The realist novel tends to grasp individual lives in terms of histories, communities, kinship and institutions. It is in these frameworks that the self is seen as embedded. J ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmnjv57xe9nyseqn4vegadn8))
- There is a difference between this realist project and the modernist novel, which quite often presents us with a single, solitary consciousness. Think, for example, of Beckett’s Malone Dies or Woolf’s Mrs Dalloway. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmnjtcw2zyxwb5zmm79jw05w))
- ‘I regard writing not as an investigation of character, but as an exercise in the use of language, and with this I am obsessed. I have no technical psychological interest. It is drama, speech and events that interest me. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmnjx7t5vwqf10g69kst37jd))

- As such, it reflects an era when identity was felt on the whole to be less problematic than it is today. People could still see themselves as the agents of their own destinies. They had a fairly acute sense of where they stopped and other people began. Their personal and collective history, for all its ups and downs, seems to represent a coherent evolution, one which was more likely to issue in felicity than in catastrophe.

- Oscar Wilde, another subversive Irishman who made a career out of baiting the British, described truth as ‘one’s latest mood’. For him to be truly free meant to be free of a consistent selfhood ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmr098mqk9rr50d0mstbs2m7))
- Yet ‘intellectual’ is one of the last words to describe his writing. His poems are built out of words, images and sensations rather than ideas. In fact, he did not believe that a poet could think in his poetry at all. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmr0cryr4w4p0zcm077m7rmk))
- One might say of a good deal of modernist writing that the true protagonist is not this or that character, but language itself. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmr0exsf0xnjwq8271w3eb8s))
