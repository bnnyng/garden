# Highlights
- Hipster is over, I think, in part because no one can — or wants to — claim their individuality at this point. It is neither interesting nor logical to separate oneself from the herd. The herd is desirable for safety in the midst of destabilization. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvbj8z3a6kg9e8y85dmxezhp))
    - Note: Interesting; people want to get attention by hyperconforming to a niche/subculture/aesthetic, serve as "doing better" than others in the community. It is a mimetic rivalry!
- The influencer is the opposite of, and the successor to, the hipster, because rather than claiming to shun attention or resist fandom they actively court it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvbjc7seegq18cs01wdbj5fb))
- breakfast tacos are culinary Esperanto. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvbj1hgajh6vshwh74xnf60w))
    - Note: Esperanto is a funny metaphor!
