# Overview

|                                                | Basic definition                                                                                                                                                                                             | Oppositions                                                                                                                           | Reductionist | Physicalist |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Interactionist substance dualism               | Mind and body are separate substances                                                                                                                                                                        | Unclear how the immaterial mind interacts with material body/world                                                                    | ✖            | ✖           |
| Behaviorism                                    | Mental states can be reduced to behaviors, or behavioral dispositions                                                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                       | ✔            | ✔           |
| Token physicalism (mind/brain identity theory) | Every **token** mental state is identical to a token brain state; that is, every token state is identical to some brain state, but the same type of token does not necessarily map onto the same brain state | Weaker than type physicalism; “anarchy”                                                                                               | ✔            | ✔           |
| Type physicalism (mind/brain identity theory)  | Every **type** of mental state is identical to a type of brain state (e.g., every instance of pain is equivalent to C-fibers firing)                                                                         | Can’t really talk about beliefs more generally; plausible that things can have the same mental state while being physically different | ✔            | ✔           |
| Functionalism                                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                                       | ✖            | ✔           |
