> [!quote] From [[@2011kim]]:
> The following answer is open to the [[Computationalist and connectionist approaches to cognition|computationalist]]: It is because a process itself is a computational process. This means that a computer simulation of a cognitive process is a simulation of a computational process, and obviously a computational simulation of a computational process is to re-create that computational process. Thus, there is no confusion in the claim that a *computer simulating a cognitive process is itself engaged in that cognitive process*.
