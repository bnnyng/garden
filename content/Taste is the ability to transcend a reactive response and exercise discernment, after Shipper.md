In the essay “[[2023-cortez-ai-abjection|AI Abjection]],” Michelle Cortez references Dan Shipper’s definition of taste:

>[quote]
>Here, taste is the “ability” to see beyond your immediate impression and arrive at a more profound, discerning understanding. … On the other side of abjection, Shipper promises, there is a hope for a “refined” or more evolved taste. If we overcome ourselves, we might expand our ability to understand, engage, and ultimately use the technology.

This definition is given in the context of the new technology of AI, which starts with “intense interest” and then transforms to [[disgust]], and finally “curiosity and hope” after “developing a taste for new technologies.”
