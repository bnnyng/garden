>[!example] Definition: Finite complement topology
>The **finite complement topology** of a set $X$ is the collection of all subsets $U \subseteq X$ such that the complement $X \backslash U$ is either finite or all of $X$. We write $X_f$ to denote the set $X$ equipped with the finite complement topology.
