>[!abstract] Theorem (Munkres 20.4): The uniform topology is “between” the box and product topologies
>On the [[The product topology|generalized product]] $\mathbb R^J$ with arbitrary indexing set $J$, the **box topology** is [[Topological spaces and open sets|finer]] than the **uniform topology**, and the **uniform topology** is finer than the **product topology**. Further, $J$ is infinite, then all three are distinct.

*Sketch.*

1. **Show product $\subseteq$ uniform.**

- Suffices to show the basis sets
