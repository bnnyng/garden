Simple embodiment, as defined in [[@1999clark]], is an approach to cognitive science that treats facts about embodied cognition and environment embedding as rules for a theory of [[Computationalist and connectionist approaches to cognition|information processing]]. At the other end of the “spectrum,” [[Radical embodiment claims that the mind cannot be meaningfully studied in isolation from the physical world]].
