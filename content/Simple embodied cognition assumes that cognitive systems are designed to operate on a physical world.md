Simple embodiment is an approach to cognitive science that treats facts about embodied cognition and environment embedding as rules for a theory of information processing ([[Cognitive science treats the brain as an information-processing system]]). On the other hand, [[Radical embodiment claims that the mind cannot be meaningfully studied in isolation from the physical world]].
