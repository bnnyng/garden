The Light Phone is a so-called dumb phone that’s “[designed to be used as little as possible](https://www.thelightphone.com/).” Its essential function is to call and text. All the rest of its scant features—notes, podcasts, music, calculator, alarm, directions, and hotspot—are optional. It has no other apps, no internet browser. “[It’s intentionally the opposite of what an iPhone has become](https://www.bryanlehrer.com/entries/new-internet/).”

I first learned about the Light Phone in July 2023. At the time, I was deeply anxious about how time seemed to be slipping away from me for a number of reasons, not the least of which was the internet’s ineffable gravity for my dopamine-fried brain. There was an impermanence to the way I traversed the internet—reading countless pages, posts, and articles, and remembering none of it—that was beginning into bleed into analog life (not *real* life, because who’s to say which is more real?). I had no goals for myself, no plan for directing my attention. After a diet of ephemeral digital scraps, my mind didn’t have an appetite for anything but the immediate. I was stagnant.

My friend had pulled out her Light Phone after the Barbie movie premiere, that extravagantly pink phenomenon brought about by some ingenious social media marketing. (That premiere was the most effective collective mobilization I have ever witnessed.) It looked like a toy, an infant Kindle. I forgot about it the day after.

In November, I was almost halfway through my gap year. I couldn’t bring myself to confess why I was taking time off, least of all to those who loved me, so I always mumbled some half-truth about “financial difficulties.” Actually, I wanted to fix myself before I lost more time. Unfortunately, physical and intellectual isolation (my childhood bedroom is my Walden pond, I joked) entrenched me further.

When, on yet another online expedition, I came across the Light Phone, I bought it immediately.

Here is a diary of how things have changed since. I will continue to update this page as new thoughts arise. I hope this can help you decide whether you want a Light Phone of your own.

My phone number is attached to my Light Phone now. I’ve gone through all my contacts, deleted most of them. I haven’t talked to some of these people since middle school! 

Typing is very difficult. My fingers aren’t used to the keyboard and hit all the wrong letters, and the screen’s response is so slow that it takes me ages to fix my errors. I can’t keep up with text conversations at all.

It took me an hour to let all my closest friends know about the switch. I told them to email me anything longer than 50 words.

My phone arrived a few days ago, but I’ve been procrastinating the switch from my smartphone. Things are really, really simple now. I know I should want change, but I don’t.

I actually tried to return it the moment I saw the package in the mail. They emailed me a reply, explaining that, as the policy on their website clearly states, they don’t do returns for non-deficient products.

I messed up something in the process of porting my number to their Light service plan, so I can’t yet use it. It’ll probably go through tomorrow.
