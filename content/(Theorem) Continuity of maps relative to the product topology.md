>[!abstract] Theorem (Munkres 19.6): Continuity of maps relative to the product topology
>Given an indexed family of sets $\{X_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in J}$, let the map to their [[The product topology|generalized product]] $f: Z \to \prod_{\alpha \in J} X_\alpha$ be given by 
>$$
>f(z) = (f_\alpha(z))_{\alpha \in J},
>$$
>where $f_\alpha: Z \to X_\alpha$ is the **coordinate function** $f_\alpha : \pi_\alpha \circ f$. If $\prod_{\alpha \in J} X_\alpha$ has the [[The product topology|product topology]], then $f$ is [[Pointwise continuity|continuous]] if and only if each $f_\alpha$ is continuous.
