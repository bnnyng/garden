>[!question]
>- Why are infinite products of compact sets not necessarily compact in the box topology?
>- Clarify why this is the case: To show $f^{-1}$ is continuous, we want to show that if $Z \subseteq X$ is closed, then $f(Z)$ is also closed.

# Overview

Compactness is a topological generalization of [[Closed sets, closures, and dense subsets|closed]] and [[Bounded sets and functions|bounded]] sets in $\mathbb R$, and specifically the [[(Theorem) Heine-Borel|Heine-Borel]] property.

In analysis, and specifically [[MATH-GU4061|Modern Analysis I]], one first defines compactness of a set $A$ using open coverings and then proves that compactness implies both closed and bounded.

>Let $(X, d)$ be a [[Metrics, metric spaces, and the metric topology|metric space]] and $A\subseteq Z$. A family of sets $\{ G_\alpha\}_{\alpha \in J}$ is called an **open cover** of $A$ if all $G_\alpha$ are open and if $A \subseteq \bigcup_{\alpha \in J} G_\alpha$.

That is, there exists some other indexing set $K$ such that $J \subseteq K$ and $|K| < \infty$.

# Review

[[MATH-GU4051|Topology]]

- When can compactness be used to verify if a continuous bijection is a homeomorphism (i.e., under what conditions do you not need to check that the inverse image is continuous)?
- Are countably infinite products of compact sets also compact?

[[MATH-GU4061|Modern Analysis I]]

- Prove the Hausdorff property holds for metric spaces. (Hint: what open sets arise naturally from $x, y$?)

[[MATH-UN1208|Honors Mathematics B]]

- Show that $(0, 1]$ is not compact. Is $[a, \infty)$ closed and/or compact?

*Proof from [[MATH-GU4061|Modern Analysis I]].* 

Let $r = d(x,y) > 0$, the [[Metrics, metric spaces, and the metric topology|distance]] between $x$ and $y$. Set $A = B_{r/4}(x)$ and $B = B_{r/4}(y)$. Then we have $x \in A, y\in B$, and $A \cap B = \varnothing$ as desired.

Let $E := \{ x_n \ | \ n \in \mathbb N \}$ be the set of all points in the sequence.
- Case 1: $E$ is finite.
	- Trick: We can make an (infinite) subsequence from a finite sequence by taking the final value over and over again
	- There exists $a \in E$ such that $x_n = a$ for infinitely many $n$
	- Make a convergent subsequence by choosing all the points that equal $a$
- Case 2: $E$ is infinite.
	- Limit point compactness $\implies$ $E$ has limit point $x \in X$.
	- For all $k \in \mathbb N$, exists $x_{n(k)} \neq x$ in $E$ where $d(x_{n(k)}, x) < 1/k$. 
	- Make a convergent subsequence by removing elements from $\{ n(k) \ | \ k \in \mathbb N$\} so that $n(k_i) > n(k_j)$ for $i > j$

*Proof of 1 from [[MATH-GU4051|Topology]].*




![[Compactness#^d5a100]]

*Proof of (i) from [[MATH-GU4061|Modern Analysis I]].*

Suppose $K \subseteq X$ is a compact subset and $f : X \to Y$ is continuous. Then let $\{ U_\alpha\}$ be an open cover of $f(K)$. By continuity of $f$, the preimages $f^{-1}(U_\alpha)$ are also open and cover $K$. Since $K$ is compact, we may find a finite subcover $\{f^{-1}(U)_i \}_{i=1}^n$. Then the union of the images of this collection is a finite subcover of $f(K)$, and we conclude that $f(K)$ is compact.

*Sketch of (ii) from [[MATH-GU4061|Modern Analysis I]]*.

Suppose $(X, d_X)$ and $(Y, d_Y)$ are [[Metrics, metric spaces, and the metric topology|metric spaces]]. To show $f^{-1}$ is continuous, it suffices to show that $f(A)$ is open for any $A \subseteq X$.

1. If $A \subseteq X$ is open, then $A^C$ is closed and therefore compact by [[(Theorem) Heine-Borel|Heine-Borel]].
2. $A^C$ compact $\implies$ $f(A^C)$ compact, hence closed by [[(Theorem) Heine-Borel|Heine-Borel]] again.
3. Conclude that $f(A)$ open.

*Sketch of (ii) from [[MATH-GU4051|Topology]].*

To show $f^{-1}$ is continuous, we want to show that *images of closed sets under $f$ are also closed*. This can be done by applying the earlier lemmas.
1. Suppose $A \subseteq X$ closed. Since $X$ is compact, $A$ is also compact (Munkres 26.2).
2. Since $A \subseteq X$ is compact, its image under a continuous function $f(A) \subseteq Y$ is also compact (above; Munkres 26.5).
3. Since $f(A) \subseteq Y$ is compact and $Y$ is Hausdorff, $f(A)$ is also closed (Munkres 26.3).
