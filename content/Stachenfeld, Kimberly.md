# Profile

>[!example] Bio
>I am a Senior Research Scientist at [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.com/) in NYC and Affiliate Faculty at the [Center for Theoretical Neuroscience at Columbia University](https://ctn.zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/people/kimberly-stachenfeld).
>
>My research covers topics in Neuroscience and AI. On the Neuroscience side, I study how animals build and use models of their world that support prediction and reasoning. On the Machine Learning side, I work on implementing these cognitive functions in deep learning models.
>
>My work has been featured in [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/01/same-neurons-may-map-physical-space-and-memories/580357/), [Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-brain-maps-out-ideas-and-memories-like-spaces-20190114/), [Nautilus](https://nautil.us/the-surprising-relativism-of-the-brains-gps-237023/), and [MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2017/10/03/148837/deepminds-new-way-to-think-about-the-brain-could-improve-how-ai-makes-plans/). In 2019, was named one of [MIT Tech Review’s Innovators under 35](https://www.innovatorsunder35.com/the-list/kimberly-stachenfeld/) for my work on predictive representations in hippocampus.
