From [[2021-sfi-foundations-of-intelligence|Foundations of Intelligence in Natural and Artificial Systems]]:
>A classic problem in machine learning is finding an appropriate trade-off between exploration and exploitation. This problem arises because once an agent discovers a beneficial behavioral strategy, deviating from that strategy in hopes of finding a better one means risking the benefits that could have been acquired by exploiting the original approach.

A common solution in [[ยง Machine learning|machine learning]] is beginning learning with a bias towards exploration and gradually shifting towards exploitation.

Alison Gopnik (UC Berkeley) theorizes that this same principle allows species with long childhoods, most notably humans, to have higher adult intelligence.; juveniles demonstrate more exploratory learning than adults. The human learning process has evolved to have children specializing in exploration, young adults specializing in exploitation, and older adults contributing to childhood exploration by transmitting knowledge back to developing children.
