In “[The builder’s mindset](https://builders.genagorlin.com/p/the-builders-mindset-a-way-out-of),” psychologist Gena Gorlin describes two common approaches to self-management that lead to unsatisfactory performance in the long run, and how “building” is a better method of goal pursuit.

The “drill sergeant” mindset is authoritarian. It chooses goals based on objective desirability (e.g., getting into a prestigious college, becoming very wealthy) rather than personal needs, leading to inner conflict and self-sabotage. After failure, the sergeant is self-berating, leading to more desperate goal pursuit in an endless cycle.

The “Zen” mindset focuses on factors of the present moment, supposedly the only factors you can control. Gorlin argues that separating the value of process, which Zen prioritizes, from the valued ends of that process is impossible. The Zen mindset causes us to miss out on “exquisite moments and heights of experience” that come with ambitious goal pursuit.

Gorlin says that both the drill sergeant and Zen mindsets separate “building site and materials from the type of building one aims to build.” In contrast to both, the “builder” mindset integrates our individual character—”our needs, our desires, our day-to-day experience of our work within the larger context of our lives”—with our goals.

>A builder chooses what she wants to build, and she holds herself accountable for the work of building it. She is not beholden to any inner or outer drill sergeant; only to her own independent, carefully formed judgment of what is worth building and how best to go about it. And she neither beats herself up nor lets herself off the hook when something unexpectedly cracks or falls out of place; rather she problem-solves like mad until she finds a solution.

Building and the builder’s mindset has several defining characteristics:
- Building involves a continuous progression of choices, which are given meaning by the context of other choices and their outcomes.
- Every task of building is constructive; the work is never menial or compulsive, but invigorating. Building is self-expressive and personal.
- Building is ambitious and goal-directed. If there is no longer value in the goal, builders move on.
