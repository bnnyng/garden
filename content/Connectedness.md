# Examples

#### Intervals in $\mathbb R$

>[!abstract] Theorem: Every interval of the real numbers is connected.

^9e43c2

On the other hand, subsets of $\mathbb R$ that are *not* intervals cannot be connected. One example is the rationals $\mathbb Q \subset \mathbb R$; then $U = \mathbb Q \cap (-\infty, \sqrt 2)$ and $V = \mathbb Q \cap (\sqrt 2, \infty)$ is a separation.

#### The straight line path

>[!example] Definition: Straight line path
>The straight line path between any two points $p : [0, 1] \to X$, where $p(0)=x$ and $p(1)=y$, is defined by
>$$
>p(t) = (1-t)x + ty.
>$$


The following sets are all path-connected, and hence connected:
- Any interval in $\mathbb R$;
- $\mathbb R^n$;
- Any ball in $\mathbb R^n$;
- If $n \geq 2$, the set $\mathbb R^n \backslash \{ w\}$ for some $w \in \mathbb R^n$;
- $\mathbb R^n$ with countably many points removed (but not *uncountably* many‚Äîimagine removing the x-axis of $\mathbb R^2$!).

Any two points of the first three sets are connected via the straight line path. In the final set, points are connected either by the straight line path or, if $w \in p([0, 1])$, we can define a path by
$$
p(t) = \left \{ 
\begin{matrix}
f(2t) &\text{if } 0 \leq t \leq 1/2 \\
g(2t-1) &\text{if } 1/2 \leq t \leq 1
\end{matrix}
\right .
$$
where $f$ is a path from $x$ to $z$ and $g$ is a path from $z$ to $y$ for some $z \in \mathbb R^n \backslash \{ w\}$; note that $p$ is continuous by the [[Continuous functions|pasting lemma]].

üî∫*Exercise.* Finish showing that these sets are path-connected by showing that the straight line path is indeed contained in the set.

# Review

- Show that any two intervals of the reals are [[Homeomorphisms and topological embeddings|homeomorphic]], so the domain of a path can be defined with an arbitrary interval. ‚≠ê
