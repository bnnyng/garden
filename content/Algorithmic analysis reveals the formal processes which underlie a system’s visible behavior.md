A systemâ€™s visible behavior is one way it expresses competency and knowledge. Formal analysis, which concerns the processes that underlie this visible behavior, includes questions like:
- What [[Representation is describing some aspect of reality with a useful symbol|representations]] does the system use, and how are they transformed?
- How do we distinguish between systems that have different algorithms but the same representations?
