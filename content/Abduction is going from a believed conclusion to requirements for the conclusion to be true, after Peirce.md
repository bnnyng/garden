**Peircean abduction** is a form of non-deductive intuition where one reasons “downward” from conclusions: after [[Four methods of fixing belief, after Peirce|fixing belief]] in a particular conclusion, one determines based on “coherence, intuition, or analogy” what conditions would have to hold for the conclusion to be true ([[@2022viteri|Viteri & DeDeo, 2022]]). In other words, the truth of previous claims are established by necessity.

In their stochastic model of mathematical reasoning, [[@2024wolpert|Wolpert & Kinney (2024)]] define abduction as using the explanatory power of a claim to infer its probability of being correct.
