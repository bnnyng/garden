According to [[2023-viteri-dedeo-epistemic-phase-transitions|Viteri & DeDeo (2023)]], the flow of reasoning based on “coherence, intuition, or analogy” can be both “up”—that is, [[Deduction vs. abduction|deductively]] from axioms—and “down” from conclusions (see also: [[Deduction vs. abduction]].

The downward reasoning can be understood as **Peircean abduction**. Abduction is a form of *non-deductive* intuition where reasoning follows
$$
\text{conclusion believed to be true} \to \text{what would have to hold for the conclusion to be true.}
$$

Similarly, [[2-SOMEDAY/2023-wolpert-kinney-stochastic-model-of-math-and-science|Wolpert & Kinney (2023)]] define **abduction** as using the explanatory power of a claim to infer its *probability* of being correct.
