- Origins of doubt and why to hold off on doubts of this world [[@2022mccarthya]]
	- Signposts vs. freedom to wander
	- The use of the unconscious in doing mathematics

Potential seeds:
- Impasse – [[Inquiry is the struggle to go from doubt to belief, after Peirce]], [[The value of a mathematical claim is guided by experiences of impasse and resolution, after DeDeo]]

Things to look into:
- Tree automata
- Program synthesis
- Sam Wang
- The Civilizing Process?
- Computational complexity of cognition
- Wittgenstein’s language games
- Michael Ralph – Radical cartography?

Research leads:
- Ann Senghas Nicaraguan sign language – modeling something?

Broad ideas:
- Embodied learning, VR for visualizations
- Model of mental illness, an ecological account
- Agent based model for key actors to collaborate on climate change

People to reach out to:
- Robin Na

Automated theorem proving
- https://lean-fro.org/events/

- Sara Walker talk at SFI
	- [[Narratives become and make reality]]
	- [[Life is a lineage of information, after Walker]]
	- The origin of life is the boundary where we can generate complexity in our universe – relationship to imagination?
	- LLMs store the dynamics of language
	- Imagination is causal, how deep in time you are
- Math is the most concise way we have of communicating information about the physical world
- Parse Walker’s book

- Peirce says truth is what wins out over long run of intelligent inquiry, related to reason “working” in *The Enigma of Reason* – best idea wins

Right now, I am mostly interested in [math](https://bnnyng.github.io/garden/tags/topic-logic-mathematics) and [cognitive science](https://bnnyng.github.io/garden/tags/topic-cognitive-science). I am also cleaning and organizing a two-year backlog of old notes, which will be published periodically.
