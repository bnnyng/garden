- Parse Walker’s book

- Peirce says truth is what wins out over long run of intelligent inquiry, related to reason “working” in *The Enigma of Reason* – best idea wins

Right now, I am mostly interested in [math](https://bnnyng.github.io/garden/tags/topic-logic-mathematics) and [cognitive science](https://bnnyng.github.io/garden/tags/topic-cognitive-science). I am also cleaning and organizing a two-year backlog of old notes, which will be published periodically.
