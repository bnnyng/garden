	- Resilience of the human body regardless
- Gender exploration and mimetic desire
	- Why was it a phase for me? Why did I lean into queer identity so much? Was it an attempt to resolve discomfort with my own body, to actively counter the embarrassment I felt at not fitting into the gender standard?
	- Why am I generally gender-conforming now?
