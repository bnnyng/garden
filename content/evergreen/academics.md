- Faculty to take courses with:
	- Richard Zemel
- Extracurricular audit:
	- Academic clubs — Undergrad Math Society (proof class), Association for Women in Mathematics, Journal of Undergraduate Mathematics, Cogsci club (e-board)
	- Volunteering and service — Housing Equity Project, pro-Palestinian activism
	- Research and work — Machine learning engineer job at Aidan’s company
	- Teaching — CSC computing fellow, CS or math TA

2024-04-03
- More specialty thoughts:
	- Use the MIT computational cognitive science course as a model — “cocosci” independent study? See yesterday’s notes, https://cbmm.mit.edu/education/courses/computational-cognitive-science
		- https://cbmm.mit.edu/lh-computational-cognitive-science
		- Unit 2 here https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/res-9-003-brains-minds-and-machines-summer-course-summer-2015/
		- Aspects of a computational theory of intelligence https://cs.wellesley.edu/~vision/
	- Machine learning (first, probability theory, statistical inference)
	- Fundamentals in computational neuroscience modeling
	- resource-constrained decision making
	- Introduction to computational leaning theory
		- https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~cs4252/

2024-04-02
- Starting Fall 2024 [course planning](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EC1K1KxJ2XQmm4FhbcpVILMZ_cCeUwDmW9XHl_NVEOU/edit?usp=sharing)
	- Definitely taking: Intro to Modern Analysis I, Topology
	- Almost definitely taking: Machine Learning
	- Would prefer to take: Honors Complex Variables, Ethics, Probability Theory (STAT)
- Choosing a cognitive science specialty – what courses make sense for computational cognitive science?
	- Honestly, will probably be heavily influenced by my work this summer
	- https://cbmm.mit.edu/education/courses/computational-cognitive-science
		- https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/9-40-introduction-to-neural-computation-spring-2018/
		- https://catalog.mit.edu/subjects/9/
		- https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/9-66j-computational-cognitive-science-fall-2004/
		- Prereqs: neural computing, introduction to inference (6.008), introduction to machine learning (6.036), introduction to probability (https://www.mit.edu/~jnt/6041-info.html), introduction to probability and statistics (https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-05-introduction-to-probability-and-statistics-spring-2022/)
	- Probabilistic programming independent study – take statistical inference first, which requires probability theory
		- Use this [course website](https://www.proditus.com/teaching/mlpp2021/) as a model
		- Possible (probabilistic models of cognition) [resources also here](https://cocosci.mit.edu/resources)
	- Reinforcement learning independent study
	- Machine learning
- Other potential cognitive science specialty – Core knowledge and decision-making
	- [Resource-constrained decision making](https://doc.sis.columbia.edu/#subj/COGS/W4800-20241-001/) – probably a spring class
	- Developmental psychology
- Computational models of perception and learning
