# General note-taking

1. **Absorb.** Identify source material. This may be written material like articles or books, or other formats like video or lecture.
	1. If the material is written, try to find a digital copy, and make highlights and comments in Readwise.
	2. (Optional) Written material – create a “raw” note of direct quotations or highlights. The note title follows the convention of \[publication year]-\[author or publication name]-\[source title]
	3. (Optional) Video material – create a fleeting note for unpolished scratchings that are taken “live.”
	4. Notes created during this step are not literature notes, and will rarely be linked to if I can avoid doing so.
2. **Process.** Create a literature note that paraphrases the original source. Sections of the literature note include:
	1. Summary – capture the main ideas from the text in an informational way, in the same vein as a scientific abstract. Make a link to the associated raw note if it exists. This section is listed first in the literature note, but should be done as the final step.
	2. (Optional) Takeaways – bullet points that I want to apply directly to my life via actions or thinking, which are distinct from a summary.
	3. (Optional) Key terms – context-dependent definitions, often lifted straight from the source material. These may be linked to “definition” (permanent) notes that contain a slightly different operational definition, or link several variant definitions of the same term.
	4. Notes – bulleted, complete sentences that paraphrase the source material. Significant or interesting points will serve as the title of a permanent note. If a concept already exists as a permanent note, that note will be revised as needed.
		1. (Optional) Subheadings reflect subsections of the source material, whether explicitly or implicitly divided.
		2. (Optional) Copy over direct quotations that I find particularly striking or informative.
		3. (Optional) Write down questions, ephemeral observations, and link permanent notes from other sources.

Ideally, **processing** should be done *at least one day after absorbing the source material*. Making and revising permanent notes is the most intellectually intensive step in this workflow and benefits from fresh eyes.

Make new permanent notes as they arise organically during **processing**.

Specific workflows for different source types, like classes, will be created later.
