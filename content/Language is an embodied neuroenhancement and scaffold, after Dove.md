According to Guy Dove (University of Louisville), language is a form of extended cognition:

>Our experience of learning language and its formal structure provides us with a valuable set of cognitive tools that we can deploy across a range of different tasks. 

Dove refers to the view that “Language is an Embodied Neuroenhancement and Scaffold” as “LENS theory.” LENS theory is one solution to the [[The symbol ungrounding problem asks how literal meanings are abstracted into arbitrary symbols|symbol ungrounding problem]]. Language learning, which involves arbitrary connections between symbols and meanings, is an example of our capacity for flexible cognition (more thoughts on arbitrariness: [[Arbitrariness in cognition]]). This theory accommodates both the role of [[Embodied cognition|embodiment]] in cognition and [[Meaning is constructed in an ad hoc way during cognition, after Casasanto]].

One objection to the theory that linguistic ability supports other kinds of cognition is that other forms of cognition can be perfectly fine even when someone has language deficits.

A compromising idea is that [[Language is enhances our capacity for abstract thought but is not strictly necessary]].
