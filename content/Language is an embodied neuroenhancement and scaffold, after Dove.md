As quoted in [[@2022millhouse|Millhouse et al. (2022)]], Guy Dove (University of Louisville) refers to to the view that “Language is an Embodied Neuroenhancement and Scaffold” as “LENS theory.” This theory supports the importance of [[Embodied cognition|embodiment]] in cognition.

LENS theory is one solution to the [[The symbol ungrounding problem asks how literal meanings are abstracted into arbitrary symbols|symbol ungrounding problem]]. 

One objection to LENS theory that linguistic ability supports other kinds of cognition is that other forms of cognition can be perfectly fine even when someone has language deficits. An intermediate view is that language enhances our ability for abstract thought (language as scaffold), but is not strictly necessary.
