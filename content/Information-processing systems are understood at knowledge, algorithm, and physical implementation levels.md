Any system carrying out an information-processing task must be understood at three levels: knowledge, algorithm, and physical implementation ([[@1982marr|Marr, 1982]]):

- [[Knowledge-level analysis reveals general principles about a system’s significance or purpose]]
- [[Algorithmic analysis reveals the formal processes which underlie a system’s visible behavior]]
- [[Physical analysis concerns a system’s physical implementation or instantiation]]

These levels are significant because different phenomena may be described using unique, level-specific principles. Under the classical approach to the brain as an [[Computationalist and connectionist approaches to cognition|information-processing system]], questions and measurements in cognitive science must target the appropriate level of abstraction. Additionally, studying the implementation of complex systems can be extremely difficult without first developing theories for “higher” levels.

The descriptions of cognitive mechanisms at each level are *content-neutral* and do not offer understanding of a cognitive system’s output. To assign meaning to these descriptions, it is necessary to consider how descriptions are incorporated into the system’s “cognitive economy” and how the system is situated in its environment. At SFI’s “[[@2022millhouse|Embodied, Situated, and Grounded Intelligence]]” workshop, Lisa Miracchi gave a philosophical argument for the importance of [[Embodied cognition|embodied cognition]]: the mental content used to give meaning to mental [[Representation is describing some aspect of reality with a useful symbol|representations]] depends on the environment, and this mental content makes a causal difference to what the system does (i.e., its output).
