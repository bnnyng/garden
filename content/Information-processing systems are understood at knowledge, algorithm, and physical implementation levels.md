Any system carrying out an information-processing task must be understood at three levels: knowledge, algorithm, and physical implementation:

- [[Knowledge-level analysis reveals general principles about a system’s significance or purpose]]
- [[Algorithmic analysis reveals the formal processes which underlie a system’s visible behavior]]
- [[Physical analysis concerns a system’s physical implementation or instantiation]]

These levels are significant because different phenomena may be described using unique, level-specific principles.

The descriptions of cognitive mechanisms at each level are content-neutral.

Because [[Cognitive science treats the brain as an information-processing system]], questions and measurements in the field must target the appropriate level of abstraction. Additionally, studying the implementation of complex systems can be extremely difficult without first developing theories for “higher” levels.
