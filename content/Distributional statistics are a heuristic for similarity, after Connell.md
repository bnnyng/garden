Louise Connell (Maynooth University, Lancaster University) researched the relationship between word similarity judgements made by humans and judgements made by machine learning models; a primary goal was to determine which features of words best predict human judgements.

In one experiment, Connell used a semantic task where agents were asked to produce a sequence of examples for a given category. Distributional models are more likely to predict the first word produced, while sensorimotor models were more likely to predict where in a sequence that a word appears.

>This suggests, she argues, that distributional information might be employed as a convenient heuristic for producing examples, but that when generating less closely associated examples, we engage sensorimotor concept representations.
