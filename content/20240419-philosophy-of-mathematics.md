See this Reddit comment:
>Some years ago, a pair of artists went into a math department and started to listen at the adjectives mathematicians use ("abstract", "violent", "elegant"...), and how they use them. Among the distinctions, there's for instance:
>- elegant/ugly
>- deep/trivial
>which are frequent in a mathematician's practice. This tells us already that not all results are considered equal; it is easy to find theorem (1043+1=1044, for instance), but mathematical knowledge is structured around a relatively small number of interesting, central or deep theorems (or maybe theories?). What makes a result deep?

>The elegant/ugly distinctions also alludes to a strong aesthetic component in mathematical practice, which I think should be squarely in a philosopher's realm to analyze, and is not mentioned in the SEP article. Along the same line, maybe playfulness could also be mentioned. I sometimes see a version of "it's socially constructed" as an answer, but I think it is more a cop-out than anything else (as in, it does not explain why a social activity would structure around these specific results, and a call to historicity only goes so far).

>By the way, what is really the place of theorems in mathematics? Such an articles would make one think that a mathematician's activity is to prove theorems, but when I tackle a new subjects, I can wait quite a long time to write any precise central statement (as in, an article can be halfway done before I have a somewhat fixed version of the main results) ; in general, such a statement does not precede the work, but follows from it. What exactly is my activity before? What kind of creative activity did I have, what is the role of new models or problems, how is pre-existing knowledge reinterpreted?
