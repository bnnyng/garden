# Overview

Bases are convenient for defining and describing [[Topological spaces and open sets|topologies]] without having to specify a large number of sets.

>[!example] Definition: Basis for a topology
>Given a set $X$, a **basis** for a topology on $X$ is a collection $\mathcal B \subseteq \mathcal P(X)$ of subsets of $X$ such that:
>- (B1) For each $x \in X$, there exists at least one basis element $B$ containing $x$ (that is, $\mathcal B$ **covers** $X$);
>- (B2) Given two **basis elements** $B_1, B_2$ and a point in their intersection $x \in B_1 \cap B_2$, there exists a basis element $B_3$ such that $x \in B_3$ and $B_3 \subseteq B_1 \cap B_2$.
>
>Equivalently, condition (B1) says that $\bigcup_{B \in \mathcal B} B = X$, while (B2) says that if $B_1, B_2 \in \mathcal B$, then $B_1 \cap B_2$ is a union of elements (sets) in $\mathcal B$.

Note that (B2) says every point in the intersection has an element $B \in \mathcal B$ that contains that point, but the intersection itself does not have to be back in $\mathcal B$!

>[!abstract] Lemma (Munkres 13.3): Using bases to determine which topology is finer
>Let $\mathcal B, \mathcal B’$ be bases for topologies $\mathcal T, \mathcal T’$ on $X$. The following are equivalent:
>1. $\mathcal T’$ is [[Topological spaces and open sets|finer]] than $\mathcal T$ (i.e., $\mathcal T \subseteq \mathcal T’$);
>2. For all $U \in \mathcal B$ and all $x \in U$, there exists $V \in \mathcal B’$ such that $x \in V \subseteq U$.

# Bases to topologies

There are two ways of going from a basis to a topology.

>[!example] Definition: Topology generated by a basis
>Given a collection $\mathcal B$ which satisfies the two conditions of a basis, a subset $U \subset X$ is said to be **open in** $X$ if for all $x \in U$, there exists a basis element $B \in \mathcal B$ such that $x \in B$ and $B \subset U$. 
>
>The **topology $\mathcal T$ generated by $\mathcal B$** is defined as the collection of all subsets $U$ that are open in $X$:
>$$
>\mathcal T = \{ U \subset X \ | \ \forall x \in U \ \ \exists B \in \mathcal B \ \text{ such that } \  x \in B \subset U\}.
>$$
>Equivalently, $U \in \mathcal T$ *if and only if* $U$ is a union of basis elements $B \in \mathcal B$ (see Munkres, Lemma 13.1).

>[!abstract] Lemma (Munkres 13.1): Every open set can be expressed as a union of basis elements
>Let $\mathcal B$ be a basis for a topology $\mathcal T$ on a set $X$. Then $\mathcal T$ is equal to the collection of *all unions* of basis elements $B \in \mathcal B$.

# Subbases

>[!example] Definition: Subbasis, topology generated by a subbasis
>A **subbasis** for a [[Topological spaces and open sets|topology]] on $X$ is a collection of subsets $\mathcal S \subseteq \mathcal P(X)$ such that $\mathcal S$ satisfies the (B1) for [[Topological bases and subbases|bases]]. In other words:
>- For all $x \in X$, there exists $S \in \mathcal S$ such that $x \in S$.
>- $\mathcal S$ *covers* $X$, so we have precisely $\bigcup_{S \in \mathcal S}S = X$.
>
>The **topology generated by the subbasis $\mathcal S$** is the topology generated by the basis
>$$
>\mathcal B_{\mathcal S} = \{ V_1 \cap \cdots \cap V_n \ | \ V_1, ..., V_n \in \mathcal S, \ n \geq 1\},
>$$
>the collection of all *finite* intersections of elements in $\mathcal S$. That is, the topology generated by $\mathcal S$ is the *union* of all finite intersections of elements of $\mathcal S$. *It is the [[Topological spaces and open sets|coarsest]] topology in which every element of $\mathcal S$ is open*.

# Review

## Definitions

- Basis
- Topology generated by a basis
- Statement of [[(Lemma) Obtaining a basis from a topology]]
- Subbasis
- Topology generated by a subbasis

## Exercises

- Check that the topology generated by a basis is indeed a topology. ⭐
- Prove that $U$ is open in $X$ if and only if $U$ is a union of elements in $\mathcal B$ (check that the topology $\mathcal T$ generated by the basis and the collection of all unions of elements of $\mathcal B$ are [[Algebra of sets|equal sets]]).
- Prove [[(Lemma) Obtaining a basis from a topology]]. (Hint: to prove $\mathcal C$ generates $\mathcal T$, use [[Algebra of sets|double containment]] to show $\mathcal T$ is the same as the topology generated by $\mathcal C$.) ⭐
- ([[MATH-GU4051|Topology]] HW1, P4) Show that the countable collection $\{ (a, b) \ | a < b, \ a,b \in \mathbb Q \}$ is a basis that generates the [[Topological spaces and open sets|standard topology]] on $\mathbb R$. ⭐
- Check the basis $\mathcal B_{\mathcal S}$ given by a subbasis $\mathcal S$ is indeed a basis; this implies that the topology generated by $\mathcal S$ is indeed a topology. ⭐
