Consciousness can be divided into two subtypes. **Phenomenal consciousness** involves subjective experiential states and phenomenology; individual instances of experience are called [[Qualia are individual instances of subjective, conscious experience arising from perceptions|qualia]]. **Access consciousness** includes all the information that is globally available for reasoning and report in a cognitive system.

The materialist position is that consciousness has a physical explanation. [[epiphenomenal-qualia|Jackson (1982)]] shows how [[Mary's Room disproves a materialist basis for consciousness]].

Scientific explanations of consciousness include:
- Recurrent processing theory
- Higher-order theory
- [[Global workspace theory]]
- Integrated information theory
