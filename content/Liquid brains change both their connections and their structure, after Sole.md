Richard Sole (Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Santa Fe Institute) defines liquid brains as those that can change not only the connections between atomic units, but also their overall structure. This contrasts with the typical understanding of the brain as a collection of fixed neurons defined by interneuron connections and how those connections change over time.

>Groups of ants can (collectively) engage in surprisingly intelligent behavior, but the locations and connections between ants are not fixed. As the ants move about their environment, they form and break connections dynamically with their neighbors.

Sole also notes that species with larger colonies tend to have less intelligent members, suggesting a trade-off between collective and individual complexity.

#open-question *How does this trade-off generalize to other collectives? More broadly, what are the inherent trade-offs for developing a collective intelligence?*
