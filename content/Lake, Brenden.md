# Research

>In our pursuits, we study human cognitive abilities that elude the best AI systems. While there are many to choose from, our current focus includes concept learning, compositional generalization, question asking, goal generation, and abstract reasoning. Our technical focus includes neuro-symbolic modeling and learning “through the eyes of a child” on developmentally-realistic datasets.
