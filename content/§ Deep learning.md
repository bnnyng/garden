# Overview

Deep learning is a particular kind of [[ยง Machine learning|machine learning]] which solves the central problem of representation learning: the difficulty of extracting high-level, abstract features from raw data. In deep learning, the world is represented as a nested hierarchy of concepts, with each concept defined in relation to simpler ones and more abstract representations computed in terms of less abstract ones.

Specifically, deep learning uses non-linear function approximations.
