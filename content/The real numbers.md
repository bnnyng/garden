The real numbers $\mathbb R$ have three defining properties: they are a [[Field axioms|field]] with defined operations of addition, scalar multiplication, and non-zero division; they are [[Ordered sets and fields|ordered]]; and they have no "missing points." Informally, these properties make the real numbers visualizable as a line. 

Formally, $\mathbb R$  is the unique [[Completeness|complete ordered field]]. As an upshot of the uniqueness of $\mathbb R$, every real number has a unique [[Decimal representation of reals|decimal representation]].
