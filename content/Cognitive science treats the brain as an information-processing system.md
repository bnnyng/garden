Cognitive science takes a **computationalist** approach to the mind, treating mental activity as formal operations (i.e., syntactical rules) on symbols and mental models. 

The alternative to computationalism is **connectionism** or **parallel distributed processing**, which treats mental activity as distributed, simultaneous signal activity. [[ยง Deep learning|Artificial neural networks]] are an implementation of connectionist theory.
