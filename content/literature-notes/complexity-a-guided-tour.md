# Notes

## Part 1: Background and History

### Key terms
- **Complex system** = [[Complex systems have nontrivial emergent and self-organizing behaviors]]
	- **Self-organizing** = [[Self-organized behavior arises without an internal or external controller]]
- **Dynamical system** = [[Dynamical systems change over time in some way]]
- **Mechanics** = the general study of motion; Newton’s work is **classical mechanics**
	- **Kinematics** = the study of how things move
	- **Dynamics** = the study of why things obey the laws of kinematics
- **Chaotic system** = [[Chaotic systems have sensitive dependence on initial conditions]]
- **Three-body problem** = using Newton’s laws to determine the long-term motion of three masses that exert gravitational forces on each other
- **Linear system** = [[Linear systems can be understood through their individual parts]]

### What is complexity?
- [[Complex systems have nontrivial emergent and self-organizing behaviors]]
- Complexity science asks how these emergent and self-organizing behaviors actually happen.

### Dynamics, chaos, and prediction
