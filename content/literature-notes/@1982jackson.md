# Summary

In "Epiphenomenal Qualia," philosopher Frank Jackson argues that consciousness is not physical and does not necessarily have physical effects. 

Jackson first discusses several arguments for the existence of **qualia** with varying *polemical utility*: the knowledge argument, the modal argument, and the "what it is like to be" argument. He then defends the epiphenomenal position, that qualia do not have causal effects in the physical world, by arguing that instantiation of qualia and physical behavior share an underlying cause.

# Key terms

- **Epiphenomenal** = a byproduct of a process, rather than a causal influence.
- **Physical information** = information about the world provided by physical, chemical, and biological sciences; additionally, notions of physical property, process, etc. which are drawn from this information.
	- **Physicalism** = belief that all correct information is **physical information**.
- **Qualia** = a mental state that cannot be revealed by **physical information** and has no effect on the physical world; rather, an **epiphenomenal** byproduct of other brain activity.
