# Summary

> Stillings, N. A., Chase, C. H., Weisler, S. E., Feinstein, M. H., Garfield, J. L., & Rissland, E. L. (1995). _Cognitive Science: An Introduction_. MIT Press.

Information processes are formal, goal-oriented operations with symbols related to information in the world. Understanding information processes requires analysis at the knowledge, formal, and physical levels.

# Key terms

- **Cognitive** = perceiving and knowing; **cognitive science** is the science of mind
- **Semantic** = a quality that describes meaningful information (e.g. having context or significance); also known as **intentional qualities**
- **Semantic mapping** = connects the representation to the **domain**
- **Semantic analysis** = concerned with a system's enviornmental structure, information access, and accomplishment of goals through deploying information; also known as **competence theory** or **knowledge-level analysis**
- **Representation** = allows information to be used for a computation; also known as **symbol**
- **Representational mapping** = connects knowledge and formal levels of analysis
- **Syntax** = rules of symbol construction; representational schemes that allow new symbols to be constructed from simpler ones are called **combinatorial**, **generative**, or **productive**
- **Semantic interpretation** = meaning of a complex symbol constructed from its "syntatic parts"; representational schemes where interpreting complex structures is determined by interpreting their parts have a **compositional semantics**
- **Algorithm** = a formal procedure or information process that operates on a representation; algorithms analyze the syntatic structures of symbolic inputs and build syntactically structured outputs
- **Implementational mapping** = connects formal and physical levels of analysis

# Reading notes

## Fundamental concepts of cognitive science
#### Information processes are contentful and purposeful
- Information processes allow a system to make a goal-oriented, systemic response to a change in environmental conditions
	- An information processing system must competently employ information
	- The process must use **representation**
- **Semantic (knowledge-based) analyses** are concerned with people's awareness of their goals and ability to use information to pursue them
#### Information processes are representational
- Understanding how information is represented for a computation is necessary for understanding how the computation is performed
- **Representations** have **syntactical rules** that allow complex symbols to be constructed from simple ones in a generative way
	- The complex symbol can be understood from the meaning of its syntatic parts
	- Algorithms can be defined by the syntactic structures of their inputs and outputs
- Algorithms represent a function correctly by maintaining the **representational mapping** between symbols and literal information
#### Information processes can be described formally
- Algorithms are formal procedures that manipulate patterns in their representation, rather than acting on a real domain
- Algorithms can be performed by physical systems (biological or engineered) without higher knowledge of their meanings, because the algorithmic process is only indirectly meaningful (through semantic mapping)
- Cognitive science distinguishes between formal operations on symbols and how symbols are related to what they stand for

## Levels of information processes

- [[Knowledge-level analysis reveals general principles about a system’s significance or purpose]]
- [[Algorithmic analysis reveals the formal processes which underlie a system’s visible behavior]]
- [[Physical analysis concerns a system’s physical implementation or instantiation]]
#### Knowledge
- Knowledge-level analysis, which includes understanding representational mapping, is concerned with the algorithm's function
- Knowledge-level analysis reveals to general principles about a system's significance or purpose

#### Formal
- Formal information processes underlie (i.e. lower level) the competency and knowledge expressed through visible behavior
- Formal-level analysis is needed to distinguish between systems that have different algorithms but the same semantics

#### Physical
- Information processes can only occur when physically implemented
- The ability of a system to carry out its formal information processes depends on its physical construction or instantiation
