# Summary

[[2010-han-the-burnout-society]]

In this collection of essays, Han develops the idea of our modern society as an “achievement society.” In contrast to the “disciplinary society” of the previous century, today’s world is driven by positivity and exhaustion. This is problematic for human culture because creative generation is only possible with profound boredom, whereas achievement-subjects are forced into hyperattention due to saturation of information. Han sees the fragmentation of multitasking as a regression to animalistic survival techniques, rather than a demonstration of advanced rationality.

# Key terms

- ***Vita contemplativa*** = the **contemplative life**.
- ***Vita activa*** = the active life.
- ***Animal laborans*** = a species that is distinguished from other animals "not by its thinking, but by its labor"; a term used by Marx to describe modern man.
- ***Homo sacer*** = "someone excluded from society because of a trespass", and thus entirely disposable (i.e., able to be killed without punishment).

# Notes

## Neuronal power
- An immunological model does not accurately explain modern society, since modern society is not troubled by a foreign Other.
	- An immunological society uses a dialectic of **negativity**, as the intrusive other is **negated** by the immune system.
	- Because there less threatening Otherness, our current society has less **negativity**.
- **Neuronal violence** comes from the excess of **positivity** in a society that overproduces, overachieves, and overcommunicates.

## Beyond Disciplinary Society
- Instead of being a **disciplinary society** with **obedience-subjects**, our current society is an **achievement society** with **achievement-subjects**.
	- **Disciplinary society** is characterized by **negativity**, using "prohibitions, commandments, and the law."
	- **Achievement society** is characterized by **positivity**, replacing laws with "projects, initiatives, and motivation."
	- **Disciplinary society** transitions *continuously* to **achievement society** in the process of increasing productivity.
- [[Depression is the defining illness of achievement society, after Han]]
	- Depression lacks an immunological explanation.
	- "Destructive self-reproach and auto-aggression" come from inability to continue achieving.
- [[Achievement-subjects exploit themselves]]; achievement society has **auto-exploitation**, not **allo-exploitation**.

## Profound Boredom

- Attitudes toward time and attention affect the structure of attention and cognition
- [[Multitasking is a regression to the behavior of wild animals]]
- In contrast, [[Humanity's greatest cultural achievements are produced through deep contemplation]], which is increasingly impossible as it is replaced by **hyperattention**.
	- **Hyperattention** is the scattering of awareness through "rash change of focus between different tasks, sources of information, and processes."
	- [[Idleness is needed for creative generation]]
	- [[Hyperattention does not produce, but repeats what is already available]]
- [[The highest form of mental relaxation is profound boredom]]
- Idleness leads to **deep attention**, which characterizes [[The contemplative life]] first named by Aristotle as a mode of human excellence in [[aristotle-nichomachean-ethics]].
