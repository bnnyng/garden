# Summary

Skinner’s attempt to make psychology epistemologically secure can be understood as allowing mental terms in psychological **explanadums** but not in **explanans**. However, his own experiments are simplistic enough that intentional attitudes are highly limited and can be assumed *a priori*, while human behavior in naturalistic settings can often be better understood in terms of mental states.

Skinner believed that self-knowledge is a social product: “The problem of other-minds causes the problem of one’s own mind.”

In contrast to stimulant-response psychologists, who view behavior as entirely dependent on preceding stimuli, Skinner viewed human behavior as **operant**, or dependent on stimuli following responses.

# Key terms

- **Operationism** = the view that the meaning of a concept should be exhausted by the tangible physical operations (e.g., physically observable phenomena for psychological concepts like “belief”) used to decide whether or not to apply the concept.
- **Radical behaviorism** = Skinner’s own term for the view that “the existence of subjective entities is denied.”
- **Explanatory fictions** = mental terms that have no reference to physical entities or processes, such as the notion of free will and Cartesian *res cogitans* (see: [[20240905-lecture-cognitive-science-from-descartes|Lecture: An Overview of Cognitive Science form Descartes]]).
- **Mental way stations** = mental terms that have a psychologically real (albeit usually metaphorical) referent; Freudianism, cognitive psychology, and neurophysiology all focus on mental way stations.
- **Skinner’s use of “theory”** = any explanation that refers to unobservables.
- **The theoretician’s dilemma** = “either mental events lawfully link environmental events and behavior, in which case we don’t need to talk about them, or mental events do not lawfully link environmental events and behavior, in which case we shouldn’t talk about them.”
	- **Brentano’s Thesis** = the view that “psychology must make essential reference to intentional mental states if it is going to do the job we want it to do.”
- **Explanandum** = in the context of analyzing Skinner’s arguments, “that which stands in need of psychological explanation.”
- **Explanans** = “that which does the explaining.”
- **Law of effect** = in language learning, “the rewarding, ignoring, shaping, and correcting of novices by mature language users.”
- **Problem of novelty** = “how it is possible to do anything which is truly new, creative, and imaginative if our behavior is the mechanical result of past conditioning.”
- **Problem of purpose** = “how it is possible to be motivated by future goals, to be forward-looking planners, to be teleologically oriented, if our current state is a straightforward product of this same past conditioning.”
- **Stimulant-response (S-R) psychology** = a theoretical approach that assumes “all human behavior can be analyzed in terms of *antecedent* eliciting stimuli.”
- **Operant behavior** = behavior governed by the **law of effect**, or behavior that is “acquired, shaped, and maintained by stimuli *following* responses rather than by stimuli preceding them.”
- **Teleological analysis** = an analysis of behavior in terms of its ends and goals.

# Reading notes

## Critique of two kinds of materialism

> In sum, Skinner thinks that one variety of mentalism, Cartesianism, speaks openly o ”fictions”; the other variety of mentalism, Freudianism (and contemporary cognitive psychology), tends to get stuck in explanatory quicksand \[by focusing on **mental way stations**].

 - **Skinner’s materialism w.r.t. the mind-body problem:** “According to Skinner, those mental events that truly exist are made of the same (physical) stuff and obey the same sorts of laws, generally the laws of [[Conditioning is the learned association between a behavior and an unrelated stimulus|operant]] and respondent condition, as overt behavioral events. Thoughts, for example, are not the immaterial predecessors of material actions, *they are actions themselves*.”
	 - “Skinner’s metaphysical commitment to the view that overt and covert behavioral phenomena are made of the same (material) stuff, and obey the same sorts of laws, implies that *potentially discoverable lawlike generalizations exist for all genuine psychological phenomena*. But it is important to notice that *this commitment is programmatic, not empirical.*”
- **Why Skinner’s behavioristic attitude feels unsatisfying:** “Thus even though Skinner’s materialistic metaphysic gives him license to analyze the world within, he persistently displays the attitude that reference to private phenomena—even if these phenomena are construed as physiological events or behavioral processes—is, by and large, more trouble than it is worth, and is to be avoided whenever possible. It is this tendency which explains the widespread feeling that even *Skinner’s mature psychology is somehow constitutionally incapable of yielding the rich promised account of the events, and the relations among the events, which take place between our ears*.”

> The thing we want psychology to do is link the environment to behavior through mentality.

## The theoretician’s dilemma

> “We cannot account for the behavior of any system while staying wholly inside it; eventually we must turn to forces operating on the organism from without” (Skinner, quoted in [@1991flanagan]).

- **Skinner’s logical argument on the optionality of considering internal states:** “The typical psychological causal chain is $E \implies M \implies R$, … then $E \implies R$. … Psychology can do its job without deploying a neurophysiological or an intentional vocabulary.”
	- **Why $E$ should take precedence over $M$:** “Because references to mental events are logically eliminable and because such references are epistemically problematic and practically useless, we ought to avoid referring to mental events whenever possible.”
- **Skinner believes that the purpose of science is prediction and control:** “The purpose of science is prediction and control and that references to mental states do not advance these goals. … One can reasonably take the opposing view that the purpose of psychology is to provide a purely explanatory account of psychological states.”
	- #concept-question What do prediction and control mean here?
- **Why Skinner’s argument that removing mental terms from psychological explanans fails:** “In highly artificial experimental situations \[like Skinner’s Spartan setups] intentional categories are assumed, and in nonartificial ones involving humans they are likely to shed some explanatory light.”

> Paradoxically, Skinner’s epistemology continually seems to refuse his own metaphysical position to go ahead and enter the realm of mentality and intentionality.

## Skinner on self-knowledge

- **Two views on the epistemic significance of language:** “If one thinks that knowledge is fundamentally linguistic, then the problems of knowing something and describing it more or less collapse into each other. … If, on the other hand, one believes that there is non-linguistic knowledge, then the problems of knowing and describing are separate.”
	- Examples: according to the knowledge-is-linguistic perspective, “if you really know the Pythagorean theorem you ought to be able to prove it on a blackboard”; if there exists non-linguistic knowledge, “it is entirely possible that I know the Pythagorean theorem but can’t put it into words.”
	- #concept-question Does the knowledge-is-linguistic perspective imply that, in using language (or math), we have touched on a “true” description of the world? (See also: [[Mathematics is the most efficient formal system for compressing information about physical reality]])
	- #open-question Any relation to the [[@2017mccarthy|The Kekulé Problem]]? 
- **Other-mind blindness:** “Skinner provocatively argues that, with respect to the problem of teaching words for private events, we are in a situation similar to that of trying to teach color words and color discriminations in a world of partially, and unpredictably, color-blind people. Whereas most of us are not color-blind, however, *we are all naturally—at least partially—other-mind blind.*”

> “A small but important part of the universe is enclosed within the skin of each individual” (Skinner, quoted in [@1991flanagan]).


>”It is social reinforcement which leads the individual to know himself. It is only through the gradual growth of a verbal community that the individual becomes ‘conscious.’ He comes to see himself only as others see him, or at least only as others insist that he see himself” (Skinner, quoted in [@1991flanagan]).

- **The problem of other-minds causes the problem of one’s own mind:** “How do we make reliable inferences about the presence or absence of \[particular mental states] in novices when we teach them these words in the first place? How do we know that different linguistically competent individuals mean the same things when we employ these terms?”

> “The public origin of subjective terms must not be forgotten” (Skinner, quoted in [@1991flanagan]).

- **Self-knowledge is a social product, after Skinner:** “How we categorize mental events, and how well we do so depends on the breadth, depth, and intricacy of the language we have learned, and on the contexts in which that language is introduced and subsequently utilized.”

## Selection by consequences

- **Behavior is reinforced by outcomes in operant conditioning:** “The basic principle of operant conditioning is this: if a response is emitted, and is followed by reinforcement, then that (sort of) response will become more probable in the future.”
- **Analogy between theory of natural selection and theory of operant conditioning:** “Operant conditioning is meant to explain the ontogenesis of new responses in the same way as the theory of natural selection is meant to explain the phylogenesis of new biological traits. *In both theories, the environment does not so much push and pull as it selects*.”

>The nature-nurture question can be \[elegantly] framed as how much behavior is the result of operant selection (and any other process operating in an individual’s lifetime), and how much is the result of natural selection?
