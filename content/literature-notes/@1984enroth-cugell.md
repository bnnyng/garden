# Part I – Basic characteristics of retinal ganglion cells
## Reasons for studying retinal ganglion cells

> Retinal ganglion cells with their axons provide the sole connecting link between the *receptive* mechanisms of the retina and the more central *analyzing* mechanisms of the visual system.

- “Principles underlying the coding of visual signals will be the clearest” in the optic nerve, since the optic nerve represents the visual signal with “*most economy and least redundancy*.”
	- Assumed due to the fact there are *fewer* ganglion cells than neurons at any other level of the visual system.
- The optic nerve is the only place in the visual pathway where flow of information is in one direction.
- Ganglion cells are convenient to study because they generate *all-or-nothing action potentials*, and can therefore be measured with less precise extra-cellular methods.

## Physiology

- **Basics of ganglion cell activity:**
	- Activity takes the form of a series of **action potentials** or **spikes**, which are the only signals leaving the eye.
	- There is a *baseline* level of activity even without specific visual stimulus.
- **Key results from Kuffler’s (1952, 1953) microelectrode studies on cat ganglion cells:**
	1. Ganglion cells have roughly circular receptive fields organized into “concentric antagonistic regions.” #concept-question 
	2. Cells are either excited by (i.e., increased firing rate in response to) light in the middle of the receptive field—**ON-center cells**—or inhibited—**OFF-center cells**.

- ON-center and OFF-center cells have opposite changes in firing rate in response to **positive contrast** (center is lighter than surrounding) and **negative contrast** (center is darker than surroundings).

|                       | ON-center cell | OFF-center cell |
| --------------------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| **Positive contrast** | Increase       | Decrease        |
| **Negative contrast** | Decrease       | Increase        |
- Ganglion cells are *most sensitive* to *spatial contrast* at the middle of the cell receptive field; that is, the cell’s firing rate can be *most easily changed* by a small stimulus falling in the center.
	- Stimulus = any *relative* difference between center and the rest of the screen, which can be achieved by changing either the center’s brightness and keeping surroundings fixed, or changing the surrounding brightness and keeping center fixed.
	- “Changing the illumination relative to the center over a large part of the less-sensitive surround can be equally (or even more) effective.”
	- #concept-question Passage implies that it is not quite symmetrical? Is this optimized?
- Ganglion cells are relatively insensitive to changes in overall luminance (as opposed to *spatial contrast* in previous point): “If the illumination over the entire center and over the entire surround are changed in the same direction and to the same extent, then there is only a small transient effect on the cell’s firing rate.”
- **Implications of *pre-existing discharge* (i.e., baseline firing rate):**
	- Stimulus strength does not need to exceed some threshold level before cell becomes active.
	- “By having a maintained discharge whose rate is simply altered by the stimulus, it is in principle possible to signal the occurrence and strength of a weak stimulus in a time roughly equal to that between successive spikes in the ongoing discharge.” #concept-question 
	- A strong stimulus could entirely stop the discharge of a single neuron—**motivation for the evolution of neuron types with opposite responses.**

> It is plausible that both ON- and OFF-center ganglion cells have evolved so that information about strong stimuli will always be adequately signaled by an increase in the discharge rate of some cells.

# Part II – Quantitative description of cell behavior
## Why a quantitative description?

- “Numbers and mathematical formulations can have more precise meanings than verbal description”; a mathematical model allows researchers to communicate findings and interpretations with least ambiguity 
	- See also: [[Mathematics is the most efficient formal system for compressing information about physical reality]].
- Mathematical models allow for *prediction* of cell behavior in response to different stimuli; “even if one is only interested in a *qualitative* prediction of the form of a cell’s response this will still in general only be possible if a *quantitative* model is formulated.”
- The *existence* of a possible quantitative analysis implies that the phenomena cannot be fully understood by qualitative means.
	- In general, maybe need more qualifications on this quantitative analysis before immediately determining it useful? See also: [[All models are wrong, but some are useful]].
