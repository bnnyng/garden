# Summary

*By Dr. Grace Lindsay* – [[Models of the Mind|Highlights]]

This book gives a history of mathematical modeling in neuroscience, a subdiscipline often referred to as computational or theoretical neuroscience. It emphasizes the many potential forms of modeling that can be used, from written equations to computer programs.

## On the purpose and schema of mathematical modeling

- [[Mathematics is a form of extended cognition]]
- Mathematics can be useful for drawing analogies between different phenomena that share an underlying mechanism.
	- #concept-question Possibly related to claim that “analogy is intelligent thinking” from [[Mitchell, Melanie|Melanie Mitchell]] and [[Hofstadter, Douglas|Douglas Hofstadter]]?

>[!quote] Quoted from Larry Abbott (2008)
>Equations force a model to be precise, complete and self-consistent, and they allow its full implications to be worked out. … Mathematical formulation of a model forces it to be self-consistent and, although self-consistency is not necessarily truth, self-inconsistency is certainly falsehood.

- The challenge in [[All models are wrong, but some are useful|mathematical modeling]] is “deciding which details matter and steadfastly ignoring those that do not.”
	- Often, models are criticized for being oversimplifying, particularly for complicated biological processes (as opposed to physics, which is more likely to be satisfactorily explained by a “grand unified theory”).
- Mathematical models are usually built by identifying relevant facts and data, then simplifying and combining the facts in a way that demonstrates the underlying mechanism behind a phenomena.

## Grand unified theories of the brain

- **Free energy** is the difference between the brain’s predictions and observations.
	- The [[Free energy principle|free energy principle]] is the notion that everything done by the brain is meant to minimize free energy.
