# Summary

[Source](https://builders.genagorlin.com/p/the-quest-for-psychological-perfection?sd=pf) – [[RAW-20220808-the-quest-for-psychological-perfection|Highlights]] – *by Gena Gorlin*

In this article, Gorlin, a psychologist, argues that, in contrast with mainstream therapeutic approaches, psychological perfection should be a goal of individuals and therapy. Gorlin’s definition of perfection is separate from the “neurotic perfectionism” that her colleagues decry; she view perfection as the Aristotelean aspiration towards excellence by maximizing our human capabilities. Part of perfecting oneself is adopting the traits of a [[The builder’s mindset|builder]] when pursuing one’s goals.

# Takeaways

- “Perfection” is the actualization of one’s human potential by achieving excellence in one’s capacities and realizing personal goals.
- People achieve actualization using a [[The builder’s mindset|builder's mindset]].

---
# Notes

- Gorlin begins by defining perfection as the “highest standards of excellence in our work and in our own character.”

## Shedding my own perfectionistic drill sergeant

- Most psychologists today are against the notion of “perfection.”
	- Perfectionism seems to be associated with depression, anxiety, burnout, and other mental health problems.
	- Perfectionism is implemented as “neurotic self-improvement” (related: [[Achievement-subjects exploit themselves]]).
- These therapeutic approaches are somewhat useful; Gorlin says that CBT has helped her get rid of a “tyrannical” drill sergeant mindset towards goal pursuit.
- Leaning away from perfectionism was positive for Gorlin.

## The cynicism of the Zen master

- In graduate school, Gorlin felt like modern therapeutic approaches were encouraging her to settle for imperfections: she didn’t pursue the most interesting ideas, her anxious attachment style was ruining relationships.

>In freeing me from the tyranny of perfectionism, the field had armed me with a fresh arsenal of rationalizations against the ambitious pursuit of excellence.

- By equating the quest for perfection with neurotic perfectionism, the modern psychological establishment is “throwing the baby out with the bathwater”; ironically, this discouragement of ambition leads to worse psychological wellbeing.

## A vision of perfection: the builder’s ideal

- Gorlin’s conception of perfection is [[Aristotle|Aristotelean]]: human potential fully actualized through “excellence in the exercise of one’s capacities and realization of one’s carefully chosen ideals.”

>[!quote]
>This is the sense in which a dish is “perfect” if it achieves its aim of nourishing and delighting those who consume it, or that a home is “perfect” if it succeeds in fulfilling the physical and psychological and aesthetic needs of those who live in it.

- Gorlin believes humans are most actualized when they use [[The builder’s mindset]]; her newsletter aims to help people develop that mindset.
- Perfecting oneself means mastering the traits which allow us to become builders: self-trust, first-principles thinking, approaching relationships as “win-win,” having purposeful routines, and responding to risk with agency.
- Builders commit to embracing experimentation and learning from error.

## A realizable ideal


>[!quote]
>\[People who successfully pursue psychological perfection\] are on a constant trajectory of **building and growing**_**:**_ **of** **envisioning and vigorously pursuing ever-new heights of perfection in their work, their relationships, and, yes, their own psychology.**

## Nurturing perfection in practice: A more ambitious therapeutic approach

- Gorlin gives different examples of how established therapeutic practices (psychoanalysis, CBT, ACT) would approach a person with a “victim” mindset.
	- She believes that they fail to leverage one’s “agency over your own mind and character.”

>[!quote]
>I conceive of human beings as fully capable of building, and re-building, themselves—motives, mindsets, emotions, action habits, and all.

- Gorlin believes that when her psychologist colleagues advocate against self-perfection, they undersell the human capacity for self-determination (i.e., from our society or ancestry).
	- To what extent might this conflict with [[Human cognition depends on artifact and culture]]?
