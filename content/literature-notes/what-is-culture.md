# Summary

[[2023-marx-what-is-culture-part-3-arbitrariness]]

In this essay, W. David Marx argues that culture is the collection of arbitrary human behaviors, meaning practices where any number of alternatives could serve the same purpose.

# Key terms

- **Arbitrary** = in language, when the sound of a word has no relationship to its meaning.
- **Coordination problem** = in game theory, a situation where all players get the best payoff by doing the same thing.

# Notes

## Part 3: Arbitrariness

- Marx begins with the anecdote of Eldridge Cleaver, Minister of Information for the Black Panther Party. 
	- Cleaver recalls how he was ridiculed for his hairstyle after moving from rural Arkansas to Los Angeles.
	- After a few months, he had assimilated into LA culture and began ridiculing other rural transplants.
- Marx’s main argument is to extend the definition of **arbitrariness** from a feature of words and language, to a feature of culture.
- Human culture is a sort of game-theoretical **coordination problem**, with a near infinite number of ways to coordinate and have the same effect.
	- This means cultural choices are arbitrary.
	- Thus, as a whole, culture includes the “arbitrary aspects of human behavior.”
	- Marx thinks the most obvious example of arbitrariness in culture is cultural *customs*, and quotes Adam Smith’s question of why a certain custom is preferred over another behavior.
- In practice, the problem with arbitrariness is that we humans want to see our own choices as reasonable and meaningful.
	- #concept-question WHY is this actually a problem? Is it in the negative effects towards those deemed cultural outcasts? Though the reason may be meaningless, the function is still important; this strikes me as not a problem that would be resolved even if our cultural choices were entirely rational.

>As humans, we must eke out an existence (the biological realm) and organize labor and resources to achieve concrete aims (the economic realm). The cultural realm describes the specific way we eke out our existence, how we feel about eking out our existence, and how we explain and understand why we eke out our existence.
