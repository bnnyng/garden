# Takeaways

- Human children, from birth to age 5, display the highest degree of general intelligence of any known entity.
- Human infants show six systems of core knowledge—objects, agents, persons, places, forms, and number—which are shared with animals, implying they come from a common ancient ancestor.
- Spelke’s hypothesis: Human rationality is uniquely enabled by the productive rules of natural language, which allows us to generate new concepts from core concepts.

# Notes

## Preface and overview

- Children are able to develop comprehensive common sense knowledge fast and flexibly—capable of learning any culture (rich knowledge) across location and history.

## What do infants know?

- [[Six systems of core knowledge, after Spelke]]

> Core knowledge systems are situated both above the peripheral systems and below our explicit conscious stateable beliefs about the world. They occupy a middle ground between sensation and perception on the one hand and explicit belief on the other.

> Each of these systems operates as a unitary whole distinct from the other systems. So they operate under different conditions. They can capture different properties of the world.

## Core knowledge systems are related because they are ancient

- Humans and animals share these systems, implying an ancient ancestor. This gives rise to all the other shared properties.
- For the systems to have persisted to the present day, they could not center on any particular properties of the environment—necessarily highly abstract and limited (i.e., not capturing details).

> Every navigable layout is going to be approximately Euclidean. Every animal is going to be capable of causing its own motion and, by moving, causing changes in the world. Every object, whether large or small, whatever it's made of, is going to move. If it moves, it will move on spatiotemporally connected paths. These abstract properties will apply in all environments.

- The systems must be localized (“encapsulated”) because if they were distributed over the whole brain, they would not have “survived” changes throughout the central nervous system.
- If ancient systems center on abstract properties, then there is “pressure to not require experience for emergence”—otherwise, would need a lot of data, because information that captures abstract categories is subtle.

## How do children go beyond core knowledge?

- Children’s learning cannot depend on core knowledge alone because:
	- Core systems are shared with animals.
	- Core knowledge is limited with details, but young children’s concepts center on them.
	- Core knowledge is domain- and task-specific, but young children develop *generalized* abilities. 
		- #concept-question What do domain and task refer to here? Generalized abilities are another layer of abstraction, above the abstraction over details in a category? Related: [[Cognitive hierarchy]]
- Hypothesis: Developmental change in language ability allows children to:
	- Form new understanding of people as both agents and social beings
	- Conceptualize objects as members of kinds
- Experiment: When two objects are shown sequentially from behind an screen, children who knew the names of the objects were more likely to expect two different objects behind the screen.

>She found that by labeling them either with the correct names or with nonsense words, but in a syntactically legal context-- like, look, a blicket. Look, a toma. She could flip them from failing this task to succeeding. When she used two different words, they succeeded on this task. When she used a single word two different times, they did not. … The use of language in this task flipped the kids.

>In further studies she showed that babies not only expect two objects when they hear two words at nine months. They expect those two objects to have different forms and functions.

## What is language doing? A hypothesis

- Language is generating noun phrases whose meaning come from different systems of knowledge.
	- E.g., “cup” is an object with a dedicated form and function; “look” is a verb that comes from a person and invites shared experience of object.

>The language that people are using, not because they're trying to teach infants anything, but simply because they're ordinary speakers who obey natural language pragmatics, that language is giving infants information about how many things are out there and what their properties are.

- Related to Smith’s work with infant data in [[2022-sfi-embodied-situated-and-grounded-intelligence]]?
- Learning natural language gives children a unique set of rules for composing new concepts from core concepts (showing features of [[Complex systems have nontrivial emergent and self-organizing behaviors|complex systems]]).

## Generalizing the hypothesis

- Language gives our species *in general* a unique set of productive rules for generating new concepts:
	- An open-ended lexicon (stock of words)
	- Rules for forming new expressions based only on the grammatical properties of words, not their meanings
	- Compositional semantics
		- “When you learn a new word, you become able to understand not only the sentence in which you learn that word, but in infinitely many other sentences that you can compose using that word. The meanings of the expressions come from the meanings of the words together with the rules for combining them to form of the expression.”
	- Pragmatics (economy, information content, relevance); “how speakers use language”
- These properties of language allow children to learn words within sentences they otherwise understand, instead of “by ostension.”
- #insight Pragmatics are the key for children to learn what to focus on, what concepts adults find most useful—building cultural inductive biases!
- Spelke does not believe language is the key to cognitive flexibility, however. 

## Testing the hypothesis and future directions

- Tomer Ullman: building machines to engage in physical reasoning.
	- Inspired by rendering objects in game design: can economize by representing objects with “indeterminate” properties; need particular location and particular mass.
	- Similar notion can account for successes and failures in infant occluder tracking experiments.
- #insight Spelke sees developmental research as a stepping stone to innovation in cognitive aides; a feedback loop to enhance our own cognition via [[Embodied cognition|embodiment]]!

>Can we come to understand our own minds both as they develop in children and in us as adults well enough that we can start making intelligent predictions in advance about what kinds of new technologies are actually going to be good for us, make us happier, make us function better, make us smarter, and what kinds of technologies are going to get us into trouble? And for any given technology, how can we design them to make them truly a useful addition to our immense cultural repertoire?
