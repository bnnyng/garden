# Summary

> [!Abstract]
>
> Modeling human cognition is challenging because there are infinitely many mechanisms that can generate any given observation. Some researchers address this by constraining the hypothesis space through assumptions about what the human mind can and cannot do, while others constrain it through principles of rationality and adaptation. Recent work in economics, psychology, neuroscience, and linguistics has begun to integrate both approaches by augmenting rational models with cognitive constraints, incorporating rational principles into cognitive architectures, and applying optimality principles to understanding neural representations. We identify the rational use of limited resources as a unifying principle underlying these diverse approaches, expressing it in a new cognitive modeling paradigm called resource-rational analysis. The integration of rational principles with realistic cognitive constraints makes resource-rational analysis a promising framework for reverse-engineering cognitive mechanisms and representations. It has already shed new light on the debate about human rationality and can be leveraged to revisit classic questions of cognitive psychology within a principled computational framework. We demonstrate that resource-rational models can reconcile the mind's most impressive cognitive skills with people's ostensive irrationality. Resource-rational analysis also provides a new way to connect psychological theory more deeply with artificial intelligence, economics, neuroscience, and linguistics.

# Key terms

- **Rationality** = an interdisciplinary principle where people act to maximize their expected utility, reason based on logical rules, and handle uncertainty according to probability theory; notions of rationality exist in philosophy, economics, psychology, neuroscience, linguistics, and political science.
- **Bounded rationality** = the theory that cognitive constraints, such as limited cognitive resources and the existence of biases, limit people’s performance from attaining total rationality (Simon, 1955).
- **Satisficing** = a heuristic that selects for the first decision option that is good enough, instead of trying to find the “optimal” decision; according to Simon (1955), the most rational decision is one that is *satisficing* with respect to both the environment’s structure and one’s cognitive limitations.
- **Rational analysis** = a paradigm, notably developed by [[@1990anderson]], that assumes human cognition is a *rational* adaptation to the environment’s structure and goals pursued within it, so that models of human behavior can be derived from formalizations of the environment.
- **Bounded optimality** = from the field of AI, “a theory for designing optimal programs for agents with performance-limited hardware that must interact with their environments in real time”; “a program is **bounded-optimal** for a given architecture if it enables that architecture to perform as well as or better than any other program the architecture could execute instead.”
	- 💭 Indicates a bottom-up approach, the opposite of top-down [[Multiple realizability and substrate independence]] in [[Classical theories of mind|functionalism]]!
- **Resource-rational analysis** = an extension of **rational analysis** that considers which cognitive operations are biologically feasible by including the structure and resources of the mind in the definition of one’s “environment.”
- **Frame problem** = “Given that everything could be related to everything, how do people decide which subset of their knowledge to take into account for reasoning about a question of interest?”
