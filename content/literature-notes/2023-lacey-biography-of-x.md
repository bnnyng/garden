# Summary

*By Catherine Lacey*

A fictionalized biography by a widow of her enigmatic wife, a “multi-hyphenate” author known as X. The story is set in an alternative-history United States where the southern states split from the rest of the country following WWII. Notably, Lacey weaves together quotations from real cultural icons of the 20th century, such as David Bowie, with her original plot.

My original review ([Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83827426-bonnie)):

> Lifting a good quarter of your novel (more or less, I am not so good at estimation) from primary sources of real 20th century icons strikes me as ambitious and potentially trite, but Lacey does this with great craft. I feel underqualified in the domain of love to comment on X and CM's relationship, so I will just say that it was a lot of fun to see how quotes were transmuted to serve the story, and I also enjoyed the cryptic, Sebaldian photographs (the layers of footnotes and image attributions were a nice touch, and for once I didn't mind repeated flipping to the back of the book).  
>
>That said, the novel reveals X's secrets too readily, telling rather than showing. The later chapters also feel redundant because we learn nothing new and almost seem like they exist just to name-drop various NYC people and scenes. Outside of the one section on X's childhood, the whole alternative history thing also fades into the backdrop and serves as an abstract source of turmoil and suffering, and I wonder why this much world building was necessary. I guess every component of the novel felt like an obvious device, and I wish I'd had to work harder!

# Highlights

- On finding comfort under an oppressive regime: “His wife had simply mistaken the simplicity of life as a form of oppression. This is one of the darker, less contested realities of authoritarian governments—that the human animal is a meek thing, easily manipulated. *No one wants to admit that they, too, might live quite happily in a simulation, in a simulacrum of life. No one wants to believe that they are, at heart, more interested in comfort than in truth*” (pp. 107-108) 
	- Quotation strikes me as being particularly pertinent today, as digital surveillance and access to information is greater than error, as well as the atrocities being committed at accelerated scales.
	- Referenced “Why Women Had Better Sex Under Socialism,” in my [[20240816-antilibrary]].
- On the self: “From 1971 until 1981—a youthful decade—I suspended the use of myself; that is, I was not here, I was not the actor within my body, but rather an audience for the scenes my body performed, a reader of the fictions my body lived. If this sounds ludicrous, that’s because it is ludicrous; it is ludicrous in the exact same way that your life is ludicrous—you who have convinced yourself, just as nearly all people do, of the intractable limits of your life, you who have, in all likelihood, mushed yourself into the most miserly allotment of what a life can be, you who have taken yourself captive and called it living. You are not your name, you are not what you have done, you are not what people see, you are not what you see or what you have seen. … For a period of years I, in my necessarily limited way, escaped” (pp. 174-175).
	- I do not particularly agree with this passage, taken from a fictional artist’s statement by X on their “performance art” of pretending to be different people for a decade, but I did find it striking. A curious thought experiment of sorts, what does it mean to be a person who is always shapeshifting and performing? This is the logical conclusion of what we all do to some degree.
- “A woman’s need for love was created by patriarchy to help men succeed in life. Women give love an independent value, while men give it an instrumental one” (p. 211)
