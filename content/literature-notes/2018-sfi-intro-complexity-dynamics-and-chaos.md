# Summary

# Key terms

- **Dynamics** = the general study of how things change over time.
	- Examples: fluid dynamics (ocean flows, gas clouds, air flow); crowd dynamics; population dynamics; group dynamics; social dynamics (conflicts and collaborations).
	- **Dynamical systems theory** = the branch of mathematics which describes how systems changes over time; includes calculus, iterative maps.
- **Chaos** = a type of system dynamics with sensitive dependence on initial conditions.
	- Example: population growth; brain activity (EEG).

# Notes

## Introduction to dynamics

- Aristotle introduced dynamics to western thought; modern dynamics came from Newton.
- Poincare challenged Newtonian dynamics and determinism, the idea that everything is knowable in principle. Poincare argued that there are certain systems with sensitive dependence on initial conditions, illustrated by the butterfly effect.
	- This was the beginning of chaos theory.
