# Notes

- The author compares McKinsey to the fabled “cabal” that controls “the direction of human history.”
- The effects of McKinsey are difficult to measure due to the firm’s secrecy and role as consultant, not final decision-maker. However, it has a notable willingness to work for “all sides,” including corrupt businesses and governments.
	- Because of its secrecy, McKinsey can benefit from clients’ success while remaining protected from their failures.
- By working for only those in power, McKinsey “solves the world’s problems” by providing solutions ([[Problem and solution space|solution space]]) that preserve the status quo.

> To quell dissent, the leader reassured us: We only do execution, not policy.

- The contrast between McKinsey’s effects and its employees’ values, such as liberal political leanings, can be explained by its partnership structure.
	- To take on a client, a partner only has to provide a team. Associates can opt out of any team they choose.
	- Over time, standards for political risk have lowered in order to maintain the company’s yearly growth.

## Direct harm serving governments

- McKinsey avoids responsibility for the actions it recommends.
- McKinsey’s “14 values” do not include the ethics of human impact.
