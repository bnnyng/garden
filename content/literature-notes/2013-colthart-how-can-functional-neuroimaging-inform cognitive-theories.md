# Summary

Research involving functional neuroimaging of cognitive processes usually has one of two goals: localization of cognitive processes in specific brain anatomy, or testing cognitive theories using neuroimaging data. Localization research is formed by cognitive theories. Testing research must embellish theories in order to make predictions about results, in particular avoiding the consistency fallacy.

# Key terms

- **Neural embellishment** = explicit claims about the relationship between a cognitive process and the physical brain
	- **Sensitivity** = the brain region will always be active when the cognitive process is being performed
	- **Specificity** = the brain region will not be active when the cognitive process is not being performed
- **Cognitive workings** = the kinds of cognitive computations that a brain area is able to perform
- **Cognitive uses** = the cognitive functions that require a specific brain area to perform cognitive computations
- **Consistency fallacy** = in order for data to be evidence for a theory, the data must not only be consistent with the theory, but also refute contradictory theories

# Notes

## Localization
- **Cognitive-level theories** about what [[The mind is comprised of interacting, interpretable modules|cognitive modules]] exist are needed interpret **localization** data about those specific processes.
	- In other words, *will localizing specific processes actually tell you anything about cognition?*
- Evidence that a cognitive module does not have a definite **neural architecture** is evidence about physical, **anatomical modularity**, not evidence about any theory of **cognitive modularity**.
- Cognitive neuroscience provides evidence for a brain region's **cognitive uses** but not its **cognitive workings**, or the kinds of computations it is able to perform.

> An interpretation is only as **valid** as the **cognitive theory** on which it is based.

> A module can still be a module even if it has no fixed **neural architecture**. 
## Testing cognitive theories
- Functional neuroimaging can be used to test cognitive theories in two ways.
	- Data is used to confirm or refute a **single model**.
	- Data is used to decide between two **competing models.**
- To avoid the **consistency fallacy**, patterns of consistent and inconsistent data must both be defined.

#### Questions for judging evidence
1. What cognitive theories is the neuroimaging data testing?
2. How should each cognitive theory be **neurally embellished** so that the data can be interpreted?
3. Is the **embellishment** for a cognitive process both **sensitive** and **specific**?
4. Is there existing neuroimaging data that is inconsistent with the theory's hypothesis?
	1. If yes, what data is inconsistent with which predictions?
	2. If no, how can the **consistency fallacy** be avoided? What data contradicts the theory?

# Reflections

- To prove **neural embellishment**, show brain region activity $\iff$ cognitive process is being executed.
- Is **neural embellishment** related to **construct validity**?
- Are there cognitive functions besides perception, language, reading, mathematical cognition, attention, and decision-making?
	- Surely some of these are more likely to be modular than others...
