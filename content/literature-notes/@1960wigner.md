## What is mathematics?

> Mathematics is the science of skillful operations with concepts and rules invented just for this purpose.

- **Although elementary mathematics reflects suggestions from the real world, advanced mathematics was invented purely for mathematical activity:** “Most advanced mathematical concepts, such as complex numbers, algebras, linear operators, Borel sets—and this list could be continued almost indefinitely—were so devised that they are apt subjects on which the mathematician can demonstrate his ingenuity and sense of formal beauty.”
	- “The depth of thought which goes into formulation of the mathematical concepts is later justified by the skill with which these concepts are used.”
	- Evokes a sense of playfulness, mathematics as a game—how to define game? ( #wip come back to this after reading *Laws of the Game*)
- **Mathematics involves inventing concepts, which should appeal to aesthetic sensibilities, outside of established axioms:** “The principal point that will have to be recalled later is that the mathematician could formulate only a handful of interesting theorems without defining concepts beyond those contained in the axioms and that the concepts outside those contained in the axioms are defined with a view of permitting ingenious logical operations which appeal to our aesthetic sense both as operations and also in their results of great generality and simplicity.”

> (Quoted from Polanyi, 1958, *Personal Knowledge*) All these difficulties are but consequences of our refusal to see that mathematics cannot be defined without acknowledging its most obvious feature: namely, that it is interesting.

## What is physics?

- **The laws of nature involve surprising regularities:** “It is, as Schrodinger has remarked, a miracle that in spite of the baffling complexity of the world, certain regularities in the events can be discovered.”
- Regularities like Galileo’s discovery that “two rocks, dropped at the same time from the same height, reach the ground at the same time” are surprising for three reasons:
	1. The regularity’s properties are invariant across our physical space and time: “Without invariance principles similar to those implied in the preceding generalization of Galileo’s observation, physics would not be possible.”
	2. The regularity only depends on a small subset of all possible physical conditions: “The irreleven”
