# Summary

[Source](https://nesslabs.com/antilibrary) – [[RAW-20231217-building-an-antilibrary|Highlights]]

An antilibrary is a curated collection of resources, including unread resources. Anti-libraries give a literal representation of knowledge one has yet to explore.

# Notes

## What is the philosophy of an antilibrary?

>Read books are far less valuable than unread ones. 

- “Embracing the unknown drives discovery”; the antilibrary represents everything left to explore, rather than a monument to everything you already know.
- An antilibrary is as expansive as possible given material constraints.

> Instead of a celebration of everything you know, an antilibrary is an ode to everything you want to explore.

## What *is* an antilibrary?

- A curated collection of resources around themes one is interested about.
- A private research tool.
- An investment in the self, which stays within one’s own means.

## What are the rules for curating an antilibrary?

- Make notes of relevant references in a given source.
	- When another reference genuinely piques the curiosity, add it to the antilibrary.
- Ask fellow readers for recommendations.
- Allow for serendipity, leaving space for chance discoveries.
- Do not expect the proportion of unread books to decrease.
- Improve relationship with knowledge.

>Remember that knowledge is a process, not a possession.
