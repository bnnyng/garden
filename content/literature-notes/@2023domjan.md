# Summary

> [!Abstract]
>
> "Thoroughly updated and revised, this new edition of a classic text for courses on the psychology of learning is more sophisticated, current, and complete than ever, while still retaining the book's signature emphasis on the "essentials" of conditioning and learning. Through four previous editions, students and instructors have relied on this book's clear, concise, and highly accessible overview of the processes and mechanisms responsible for conditioning and learning. Domjan and Delamater summarize major theories of how humans and nonhuman animals learn, along with the classic experiments that support these theories and how they have been applied to address real-world problems."
