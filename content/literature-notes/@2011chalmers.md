# Key terms

- **Computational sufficiency** = the view that having the right kind of computational structure is sufficient for having a “mind.”
	- Related: [[Under computationalism, simulating a cognitive process is equivalent to engaging in that cognitive process]]
- **Computational explanation** = the view that computation is a valid general framework for explaining cognitive processes and behavior.
- **Implementation** = the relation between an abstract computational object (e.g., a computation) and a physical system, such that “the system ‘realizes’ the computation, and the computation ‘describes’ the system.”
- **Programmable** = the ability to implement many computations.
- **Organizational invariant** = a property that is invariant with respect to the *causal topology*. 
- **Strong artificial intelligence** = the view that there exists some computation such that *any* implementation of the computation can be said to have a mind.

# Reading notes

## A theory of implementation

> A physical system **implements** a given computation when the causal structure of the physical system mirrors the formal structure of the computation.

- Implementation is an [[Isomorphism|isomorphism]] between the formal structure of a computation and the causal structure of a physical system.
## Computation and cognition

- **A computation is an abstract specification of the causal organization of a system:** “If cognitive systems have their mental properties in virtue of their causal organization, and if that causal organization can be specified computationally, then the thesis of **computational sufficiency** is established. Similarly, if it is the causal organization of a system that is primarily relevant in the explanation of behavior, then the thesis of **computational explanation** will be established.”
- **Mental properties are organizational invariants.**
	- **Two kinds of mental properties:** “Psychological properties are concerned with the sort of thing the mind *does* (i.e., causal role), and phenomenal properties are concerned with the way it *feels* (i.e., consciously experienced).”

> The question about whether a computational model simulates or replicates a given property comes down to the question of whether or not the property is an organizational invariant.
