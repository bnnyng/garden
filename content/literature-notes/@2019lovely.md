# Summary

Originally published anonymously, this article was written by a former employee of McKinsey & Company, the most prominent of the “Big Three” consulting firms. The author claims that McKinsey is “capitalism’s most effective messenger” and thus determined capital’s impact on the world.

# Selected concepts and passages

- To those convinced that a secretive cabal controls the world, the usual suspects are Illuminati, Lizard People, or “globalists.” They are wrong, naturally. There is no secret society shaping every major decision and determining the direction of human history. There is, however, McKinsey & Company.
- Your views of McKinsey’s impact on the world will be largely determined by your views on capitalism’s impact on the world, for few firms have made a greater impact on the prevailing economic system.
- Working for all sides, McKinsey’s only allegiance is to capital. As capital’s most effective messenger, McKinsey has done direct harm to the world in ways that, thanks to its lack of final decision-making power, are hard to measure and, thanks to its intense secrecy, are hard to know.
- Our team of mostly young do-gooders were concerned about the role we were playing to enable this shift. We were up-in-arms! Well, as up-in-arms as overachieving Ivy League graduates get. To quell dissent, the leader reassured us: We only do execution, not policy.
- McKinsey remains the world’s largest partnership, and partners rule. The general rule of thumb is that if a partner can staff a team, the firm will do the work. If associates don’t want to work with a tobacco company or a defense contractor, they don’t have to. As a result, only a small portion of the consultants need to buy into a client relationship for McKinsey to do work with them.
- Perhaps the greatest secret to McKinsey’s success is its ability to benefit from its clients’ successes without being punished for their failures, no matter what role the firm had to play in either outcome.

# Reading notes

- The author compares McKinsey to the fabled “cabal” that controls “the direction of human history.”
- The effects of McKinsey are difficult to measure due to the firm’s secrecy and role as consultant, not final decision-maker. However, it has a notable willingness to work for “all sides,” including corrupt businesses and governments.
	- Because of its secrecy, McKinsey can benefit from clients’ success while remaining protected from their failures.
- By working for only those in power, McKinsey “solves the world’s problems” by providing solutions ([[Problem and solution space|solution space]]) that preserve the status quo.

> To quell dissent, the leader reassured us: We only do execution, not policy.

- The contrast between McKinsey’s effects and its employees’ values, such as liberal political leanings, can be explained by its partnership structure.
	- To take on a client, a partner only has to provide a team. Associates can opt out of any team they choose.
	- Over time, standards for political risk have lowered in order to maintain the company’s yearly growth.
