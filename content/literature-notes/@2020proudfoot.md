# Summary

Proudfoot argues [[The Turing test]] intends for [[§ Intelligence|intelligence]] to be a **response-dependent concept**, which is entirely dependent on the human judgement it generates: “Turing undermined the idea that intelligence is a feature of the world independent of our tendency to ‘imagine’ intelligence in things.”

# Key terms

- **Emotional concept** = a concept where application is determined “as much by our own state of mind and training as by the properties of the object under consideration.”
- **Response-dependent concept** = “one that exhibits a conceptual dependence on or interdependence with concepts of our responses in certain specified conditions”; one example is *color*.

# Reading notes

>[!question]
>- What features of the world are actually independent of our tendency to imagine those features?
>- “He clearly intended his test as a test for thinking”—what is the relationship between intelligence and thinking? Thinking is unnecessary?

>[!quote] From “Intelligence as an Emotional Concept” (Turing 1948):
>The extent to which we regard something as behaving in an intelligent manner is determined as much by our own state of mind and training as by the properties of the object of consideration.
