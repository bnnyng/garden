# Summary

While most Socratic dialogues take place in public, the “Phaedo” is a uniquely private conversation with friends and supporters of Socrates. The events are preceded by “The Apology,” which is Socrates’ speech in defense of philosophy before a jury; “Phaedo” is a second defense speech for people who already know how to pursue philosophy.

“Phaedo” is Plato’s “manifesto” to represent Socratic values, rather than what Socrates would realistically say; the dialogue is a “rational reconstruction.”

The underlying argument of the “Phaedo” justifies why Socrates lived his life as he did. Philosophy itself is the main character!

# Notes

## The philosopher's attitude to death
- The dialogue is fundamentally *ethical*, rather than metaphysical: The discussion tackles the *emotional gap* between Socrates and his followers.
- "Many say that philosophers are nearly dead."
	- This joke reveals more about death as a *key term*:
		- *Death* = separating soul from body
		- *Dying* = the ongoing process of practicing for death.
	- Socrates is *worldly* in terms of relationships and social involvement, but *unworldly* because he is unconcerned with worldly issues.
	- Socrates argues that the *life of the body* is the *death of reasoning*, while the life of the soul comes after death. 
		- Athenians would see it the "usual" way: Death is imprisonment.
- Socrates has two conclusions:
	- To practice philosophy in the proper manner is to practice for dying and death,
	- The true philosopher should not resent death.

#### Argument reconstruction \[64c-66e]

1. The body is an obstacle in the acquisition of wisdom (i.e., knowledge of genuine realities) by the soul.
2. A true philosopher wants to pursue knowledge of genuine realities above all as their characteristic life-activity.
3. *Hence*, a true philosopher turns away from the body as much as possible to the soul.
4. Death is the separating of the soul from the body.
5. *Hence*, death facilitates the true philosopher’s search for wisdom.
6. The true philosopher should welcome (and not resent) whatever facilitates their characteristic life-activity.
7. *Hence*, the true philosopher should welcome (and not resent) death.

## Preliminary arguments for the immorality of soul
## Understanding soul
- English uses of **soul** usually have two different meanings.
	- **Soul** is used to describe living things themselves in a special, poetic context (e.g., "Not a soul in sight").
	- **Soul** can also be a source of life or personality (e.g., "soul food," "felt it in the soul"). The soul is an *animating principle* that explains some feature, not a *discrete object* itself.
- In Greek, **psyche** means "whatever it is that makes living things alive" (i.e., animates them).
	- The source of life *is* itself a discrete object.
	- Socrates seems to be endorsing (via dialectical inquiry and proposing, "What do you say ... ?") that **soul** is what makes us alive when we're alive.
- "What gives consistent personality over time?" is a modern iteration of the question, "What is the soul?"
### The cyclical argument (70c-72e)
#### Cebes' objection (70a-b)
- Cebes uses the Homeric **soul** to describe "dying breath" that leaves the body.
	- For Socrates' argument to go through, the soul must survive death. 
- Socrates responds with an "Anaxagorean mode" of **natural philosophy** by generalizing **soul** to all living things (70d).
	- The pre-Socratic reference is reason for suspecting this is not Socrates' final argument.
	- Cebes' objection is based on the **natural philosophical** theory of "things coming to be and changing," so Socrates gives the appropriate opposing **natural philosophical** response.
#### Argument reconstruction
1. All things that have opposites come from their opposites come to be from their opposites.
2. Being dead is the opposite of being alive.
3. Between two opposites, there are two opposed processes.
4. *Hence*, there is a process of coming to be from being alive (dying), and coming to be alive from being dead (vivifying).
5. \[ (Parmenidean premise) What something comes to be from must pre-exist. ]
6. *Hence,* souls of the dead must be somewhere before the vivify.
7. (Anaxagorean premise) Opposite processes must be balanced.
8. *Hence,* the souls of those who die must vivify.
#### Reasons for suspicion
- Socrates uses the analogy that "asleep" and "awake" are opposites, which come to be from each other through the opposite processes of "waking" and "drowsing."
- However, there is definitely one individual going through the *cycle,* whereas there is no evidence for a continuous soul that links "dead" and "alive." Thus, the **recollection argument** is needed to provide evidence of the soul's *continuous existence*.
### Recollection argument (72c-76e)
#### First stage
1. Recollection implies having prior knowledge of a thing.
2. When someone notices similarities (i.e., by sensing equalities) in order to know about something, they are brought to knowledge by recollection.
3. When we have a sensory experience of the equality of two things, we notice ways that this equality is deficient to Equality itself.
4. *Hence,* our sensory experience of equality makes us think about Equality itself.
#### Second stage
5. Knowledge of Equality itself is different from knowledge of equality in sensory experience.
6. (From 2, 4, and 5) *Hence,* we recollect Equality itself on the basis of our sensory experience of the equality of things.
7. (From 1 and 6) *Hence,* we must have had prior knowledge of Equality itself before we had sensory experience of the equality of things.
#### Third stage
8. We begin to have sensory experiences from birth.
9. *Hence,* we must have had knowledge of Equality (and other "what it is" things in reality) before birth.
## The final argument for the immortality of soul

### Paradoxes of change

> [!quote]
> Imagine not being able to distinguish the real cause from that without which the cause would not be able to act as a cause. (Phaedo, 99b)

- Explanations must distinguish between "the real cause" and "what needs to exist for the cuase to operate."
	-  **Explanatory regress** = as demonstrated by Anaxgoras, the cause is continuously credited to the thing that came before.
	- Example: Food is not the cause of nutrition.
	- Example: Arithmetic symbols in math are incidental, they don't explain *why* 8+2=10. In fact, symbols indicate an explanation is needed.

> [!quote]
>That seemed to me much like saying that Socrates’ actions are all due to his mind, and then in trying to tell the causes of everything I do, to say that the reason that I am sitting here is because my body consists of bones and sinews, ... , and that is the cause of my sitting here with my limbs bent. (Phaedo, 98d)

- Socrates critiques Anaxagoras’ theory of mind as a moving principle, which allows different properties to come together and separate.
	- Socrates is initially optimistic about "Mind" as a first cause.
- Explanations must be *uniform* in all cuases of chnage.

### The new hypothetical method

> [!quote]
> I would gladly become the disciple of any man who taught the workings of that kind of cause. However, since I was deprived and could neither discover it myself nor learn it from another, do you wish me to give you an explanation of how, as a **second best,** I busied myself with the search for the cause, Cebes? (Phaedo, 99c)

- Socrates has given up on a **top-down explanation**; instead, his **"second sailing"** settles into an *explanatory niche.*
- An explanation is considered **unsafe** when it can be used to explain the opposite change in another context (echoes criteria for a good account in the "Euthyphro").
- The **new hypothetical method** is different from the geometric hypothesis in the "Meno."
	- **Geometric hypothesis** = a *constructive* proof, deriving something more general (i.e., a mathematical [[Propositional logic|proposition]] or theorem) from specific successful examples.
	- The Greek **hypothesis** is a **stepping stone**, not a theory to be assumed or tested.
	- The geometric hypotheical method doesn't work for making a general account of change because the changes are too varied; inquiry is impossible to start.
	- The **new hypothetical method** is **logical.**

> [!quote]
> A similar thought crossed my mind, and I feared that my soul would be altogether blinded if I looked at things with my eyes and tried to grasp them with each of my senses. So I thought I must take refuge in discussions and **investigate the truth of things by means of words**. (Phaedo, 99e)

##### Socrates' hypothesis
- What are the metaphysics of perfect accounts?
	- "Accounts of something explain change *with regards to* that thing."
	- Example: Beauty explains the beauty of some particular **instantiation** of beauty.

> [!quote]
> All beautiful things are beautiful by the Beautiful. That, I think, is the **safest answer** I can give myself or anyone else. (Phaedo, 100e)

- **Explanation by Forms** = "particular fs have f-ness because of F itself."
	- A *local explanation* of beauty depends on the features (e.g., color, shape) of the instantiated element, but the *global explanation* is general.

### The final argument

#### Three-level ontology
- The final argument is important because it gives a general explanation for a world in *flux*.
	1. **Forms** = the ultimate causes/explanations. 
		- "The F itself never causes anything to be non-F in any respect."
	2. **Properties** = the qualities of something *instantiating* some **Form** that are **uniform**.
		- **Uniform** = never becoming its opposite.
		- Properties come to be and pass away along with the instantiated object.
	3. **Particular things** = bearers of properties, which are always changing.
- **Change** is the *displacement* of one **property** by another (i.e., one property "wins" over the other).

#### Higher hypothesis
- Some **particulars** bear **properties** necessarily and always by their *nature*. 
	- Examples: Fire is the **bearer** of hot, because fire makes things hot; likewise, three is the **bearer** of odd.
- Socrates argues that the soul is the **bearer** of life.

#### The immortality of soul
- The **final argument** presents soul and life similarly to the **affinity argument**.
	- When individuals **change** with regards to some **property**, the **opposite** property is displacing it; it either flees or is destroyed.
	- When the opposite approaches a **bearer**, the bearer must be destroyed.
	- When death approaches the soul, the soul cannot *admit* death.
- The soul is immortal because it is both *the cause of life* and *something that has life*. Socrates argues that "nothing like this can die."
