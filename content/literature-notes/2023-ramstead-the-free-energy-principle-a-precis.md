# Summary

*By Maxwell Ramstead* – [Article link](https://archive.ph/OCalM) – [[RAW-20240124-the-free-energy-principle-a-precis|Highlights]]

The free energy principle says that if a random dynamical system has the right kind of “sparseness,” then subsets of that system will seem to track each other. In practice, the FEP is behind the use of Bayesian mechanics to model adaptive, self-organized behavior.

# Key terms

- **Bayesian mechanics** = a class of mechanical theories that partitions a system into distinct, coupled “particles” or “things,” and models the evolution of those units over time.
- **Sparse coupling** = “the idea that things can be defined in terms of the *absence* pf direct influence between partitioned subsets or particles of a system.”
- **Markov blanket** = a formalization of the “sparseness” in a physical system; the blanket is the set of states where states internal to some particle are independent of states external to the particle

# Notes

- Dynamics are formal descriptions of physical behavior. Mechanical theories explain dynamics, and principles tell us where mechanics come from.

>Importantly, the FEP is not an empirical theory that could be subjected to verification or falsification. Rather, much like the principle of least action or the principle of maximum entropy in physics, the FEP is used to write down theories that can, in turn, be subjected to empirical verification procedures.

- The FEP says that things which are coupled, yet distinct from one another will end up tracking the statistics of the things that they are coupled.
	- Formally, this behavior is called **abductive inference**.
- More precisely, the FEP states that if a system contains a Markov blanket, then states inside the boundary will look like they encode a Bayesian belief (i.e., conditional probability distribution) about states external to the boundary.
- The FEP inverts traditional directions of explanation in science.
	- Rather than explaining observed phenomena, the FEP begins by saying that if things exist, then they can be modeled to minimize free energy or surprise.
	- Rather than treating the behavior of complex systems as new emergence from more basic phenomenon, the FEP says that emergent behavior from the whole comes from restrictions on the parts.

>Under the FEP, the novel capabilities of the whole are underwritten by the fact that the whole is less than the sum of its parts. Indeed, a whole can only function as an integrated whole if we remove degrees of freedom from its parts.

- Philosophical implications: the FEP is an “anti-reductionist” emphasis on the causal contributions of each unit to the system’s dynamics.

>The conceptual revolution introduced by classical mechanics abolished the distinction between sublunary and supralunary spheres of existence, since it could be shown that the dynamics of supralunary and sublunary things were governed by the same principles. Similarly, the FEP stands in contrast to approaches that would split the sphere of mind or life from the sphere of physical phenomena, such as some versions of the enactive approach (e.g., [[34]).](https://archive.ph/OCalM#_bookmark39) The FEP eschews all such distinctions and embraces a physics of thingness that ranges from subatomic particles to galaxy clusters—and every kind of thing in between.
