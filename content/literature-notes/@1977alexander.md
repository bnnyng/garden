## Patterns

- Patterns are a network from simple construction procedures to higher, “larger” patterns of social organization and urban planning.
	- “Each pattern can exist in the world, only to the extent that it is supported by other patterns.”
	- “It says that when you build a thing you cannot merely build that thing in isolation, but must also repair the world around it, and within it, so that the larger world at that one place becomes more coherent, and more whole.” (xiii)
	- Patterns are [[Complex systems have nontrivial emergent and self-organizing behaviors|complex systems]]!
- Patterns are conceptualized (and listed) top-down, but built bottom-up—any analogies to top-down, bottom-up approaches to [[§ Intelligence]]?
- Patterns are compressed in a single structure; like English, both in poetry and ordinary language, each component carries “whispers of the meanings” of the others.

### Towns

**3. City Country Fingers**
- Underlying assumption: People need access to the countryside and wilderness.
- Cities must be bounded by country at every point; one method is “fingers” of country throughout urban areas so that no city person is more than one mile or 10 minutes away from country.
- The small space is feasible because 90 percent of all farms are 500 acres or less; see Keyserling 1965, *Agriculture and the Public Interest*.

>The suburb is an obsolete and contradictory form of human settlement. (30, Lace of Country Streets)

**7. The Countryside**
- “There is only one kind of nonurban land—*the countryside*” (37).
- Public parks should all be operational farms, and vice versa; “stewardship” collectives are responsible for land areas and establishing ground rules for public visitors.

**8. Mosaic of Subcultures**
- “What appears heterogenous turns out to be homogenous and dull” (43).
- To Alexander, the homogeneity of a region causes weakness of character in the people—quite reminiscent of [[2023-eilenberger-the-visionaries|Ayn Rand]].
## Themes

### Community size

- *Independent (metropolitan) regions* should be between 2 and 10 million people in order to be autonomous enough to have their own “sphere of culture.”
	- People in larger regions become removed from the regional government; smaller regions fail to get representation in world government among today’s nation-states.
### Ecology

- Metropolitan regions must be small and self-governing to solve environmental problems in a direct way; see Gravier’s “Europe of the Regions.”
- Ownership of farmland as a type of stewardship with ecological responsibilities.

### Collective vs. individual

>[!quote]
>In a society where a man can find his own self, there will be ample variety of character, and character will be strong. In a society where people have trouble finding their own selves, people will seem homogenous, there will be less variety, and character will be weak. (46, Mosaic of Subcultures)

- The solution to homogeneity is a variety of subcultures, among which each individual “receives support for his idiosyncrasies from the people and values which surround him.”
