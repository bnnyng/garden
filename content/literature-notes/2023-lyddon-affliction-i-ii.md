# Summary

*By Rose Lyddon* – [Affliction](https://roselyddon.substack.com/p/affliction) – [Affliction II](https://roselyddon.substack.com/p/affliction-ii) – [[RAW-20231228-affliction-i-ii|Highlights]]

In the essays “Affliction” and “Affliction II,” Lyddon, a religion graduate student, discusses [[Weil, Simone|Simone Weil’s]] philosophy of affliction. For Weil, affliction carries the risk of dehumanization, the highest risk, but affliction is also one’s only hope of achieving grace and growing in moral character. 

In “Affliction II,” Lyddon discusses Weil’s personal history and uniquely experiential method for her ideas about risk. Lyddon then reflects on risk and coercion in the modern day, arguing that the goal of safety and production has led to the “instrumentalization” of individuals.

# Notes

## Affliction

>[!quote]
>Slavery as practised by ancient Rome is only an extreme form of affliction. The men of antiquity, who knew all about this question, used to say: “A man loses half his soul the day he becomes a slave

- [[Weil, Simone|Weil’s]] notion of affliction is a death of human dignity and soul; afflicted people act with servility.

>[!quote]
>Affliction is not suffering, which can be borne. Affliction destroys something essential to the human person.

- Weil distinguishes between so-called human rights and justice.
	- Legal rights are “contentions of entitlement”; to say that the afflicted have had their rights violated is an understatement.

>[!quote]
>The cry of the afflicted isn’t a demand for rights but a wounded howl. … The afflicted cannot speak in a language a court will recognize.

>[!quote]
>The great enigma of human life is not suffering but affliction. It is not surprising that the innocent are killed, tortured, driven from their country, made destitute, or reduced to slavery, imprisoned in camps and cells… But it is surprising that God should have given affliction the power to seize the very souls of the innocent and to take possession of them as their sovereign lord. — [[Weil, Simone|Simone Weil]]

- People’s reactions to affliction come from humans’ “carnal nature”; this shared nature with animals is why we attack weakness.
	- What else leads people to animalic behavior in the present day? According to [[2010-han-the-burnout-society|Han (2010)]], it’s [[against-multitasking|multitasking]].

>[!quote]
>Affliction removes the disguise of reason and reveals the lowest and most animal parts of our nature, for both the afflicted and the unafflicted.

- Lyddon gives a personal example of affliction: addiction. 
	- Addiction is “below thought and below dignity,” “below sense and moral reason.”
	- The only freedom from affliction’s *gravity* is through “supernatural” *grace*.
- Grace is the faith in God’s divine justice. Thus, Christian faith is what raises the afflicted, and those who respond to the afflicted, from the condition of animals.

>[!quote]
>”Not my will but thine be done” is a recognition that no circumstance within this life could detract from the justice of divine will. An act of faith like this means that suffering, no matter how intolerable or unjust, will not lead to the affliction which separates a person from God. In this way a soul can be drawn out of affliction.

- All worldly beauty can only be found in risk; “the aesthetic of despair” lies in safety, when people are constrained by fear and the need for control.
- The afflicted can only be loved when control is meaningfully relinquished to divine will.

>[!quote]
>The saint kisses lepers.

- Weil sees affliction represented in ancient civilizations via the Iliad.

>[!quote]
>”It is the Trojan lad dispatched to Hades, though he does not wish to go, who comes to mind when Christ says to Peter: “Another shall gird thee and carry thee whither thou wouldst not.” This accent cannot be separated from the idea that inspired the Gospels, for the sense of human misery is a pre-condition of justice and love.” — [[Weil, Simone|Simone Weil]]

- Lyddon comments that modernity’s “cult of progress” and “belief in the freedom of the individual to change his own life” leads to affliction.
	- Such affliction is a direct consequence of our conditions, the neoliberal regime; echoes criticisms made by Han in [[2010-han-the-burnout-society]]?
	- Can we engineer a world without affliction? Or will safety always lead to an “aesthetic of despair”? Is there such a thing as compromise, or will there always be dehumanizing affliction (although in Weil’s cosmology, this is not a net issue, as affliction gives rise to transcendental grace)?

## Affliction II

- Weil’s attraction to “ancient virtues” described in the Iliad, Gospels, and Platonic dialogues was likely a response to the devastating events of the 1930s and 40s.
- Despite coming from a privileged background, Weil sought out affliction: keeping enough wages to equal unemployment and donating the rest; eating only as much as soldiers at the front during war; enrolling in factory work and the International Brigades and being an “active liability” in both.

>[!quote]
>She could be accused, like St Rose of Lima or Lana del Rey, of romanticising suffering without really understanding the condition of someone trapped by it. But I think it’s more that Weil thought with her entire being. Her intellectual experiments required commiting her entire lifestyle to a proposition to explore whether there was any truth to it. Her thought was fundamentally experiential, governed above all by her encounters with supernatural grace.

- Weil’s actions were a way of [[Doing philosophy|doing philosophy]] that was unique among her contemporaries (Simone de Beauvoir, Ayn Rand).
	- Lyddon relates with her own practice of “inhabiting” ideas in order to understand them. 
	- In a throwaway comment, she refers to it as perhaps being “poor theory of mind more than anything else”; is the need for experience to develop full empathy a character deficit?
- Living as a practice of ideas allows Lyddon to endure painful experiences by approaching them with curiosity, as opportunities for learning.
- Lyddon believes that affliction can only be understood through direct experience.

>[!quote]
>Affliction destroys intelligence and renders the afflicted mute. But neither can someone who has not experienced affliction hope to describe, understand or begin to solve it. Going through the pain and managing to survive, soul intact, is necessary not only for the saint but also for the theorist, the educator, any person who hopes to be of any help.

- [[Risk is necessary for intellectual life, after Weil]]
- Although Weil’s theory of affliction and grace focuses on individual morality, Lyddon also expresses appreciation for civilization as “the edifice built up around human nature that molds it into something capable of higher things like morality and rationality.”
	- Related to [[aristotle-nichomachean-ethics]], where the political life is a means of creating society to make room for [[The contemplative life]].
	- Lyddon sees civilization as a way to rescue those who cannot achieve a state of grace.

>[!quote]
>Not everyone who follows the path to sanctity will make it; some, unable to fully place their lives in the hands of God, will be eaten up by their lower natures. If grace can’t save everyone, then coercion is necessary to prevent social and political disaster.

- Lyddon reflects on risk in the modern day, noting that the purpose of coercion (i.e., the point of political theory, often veering toward authoritarianism) is no longer religious salvation, but pared down safety and production.
	- One striking example is the pop-psychology of language of toxicity, abuse, and trauma.
	- How to push the boundaries without aligning with reactionaries?

>[!quote]
>A person matters not because of the dignity of each individually created soul but because of the instrumentalisation of their productive capacity and their ‘human rights’, which are claims of entitlement without teleology. A secularised universalism believes in salvation for none and maximum utility for all. Risk is minimised through state institutions designed for safeguarding (this, rather than education, is the principal purpose of schools.) In the absence of any framework for talking about souls, salvation, the high drama of human life with its great risks and rewards, inner lives and relationships are kept within a safe middle zone, the bounds of which are policed zealously.

>[!quote]
>The only ethical life risks living unethically. It accepts the risk that the very faculties that allow moral and rational life may be corrupted. The Christian entering the gladatorial arena could, at the last moment, be consumed by the terror of death and lash out in wild panic, killing her persecutors. It’s only by risking this possibility and enduring in faith until the end that she becomes a martyr.
