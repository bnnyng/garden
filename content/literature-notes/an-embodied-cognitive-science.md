# Summary

[[1999-clark-an-embodied-cognitive-science]]

The author describes the difference between two different approaches to facts about embodiment, which involves the physical relationship between an intelligent system and bodily and environmental properties. In “simple” embodiment, properties of the physical world provide rules to constrain cognitive science theories. “Radical” embodiment sees the representational theories of cognition as inadequate, and seeks to develop a new framework for cognitive science.

# Key terms

- **Adaptive coupling** = when a system develops a mechanism to track the behavior of another system (typically an evolved mechanism in animals).
- **Simple embodiment** = approaching facts about embodiment as *rules* for a theory about information processing ([[Simple embodied cognition assumes that cognitive systems are designed to operate on a physical world]]).
- **Radical embodiment** = [[Radical embodiment claims that the mind cannot be meaningfully studied in isolation from the physical world]]
- **Deictic pointer** = a physical action that has the *functional role* of binding computational memory/output to a feature of the external world.

# Notes

## Embodiment and computation
- [[Representation-hungry systems maintain complex internal states and perform offline computations linearly]]
- In contrast, in the [[Dynamic coupling]] model, internal computational tasks must remain coordinated with the external environment to perform “live” adjustments.
	- Such computations are necessarily less expensive than [[Representation is describing some aspect of reality with a useful symbol|representations]].
	- The priority is to achieve “equilibrium” that “couples” the agent and world.

## Radical embodiment and advanced cognition

- [[Radical embodiment suggests alternative ways to decompose cognitive systems]]
- [[Human cognition might depend on artifact and culture]]
	- [[Wideware allows for extended cognitive systems beyond the isolated biological brain]]
