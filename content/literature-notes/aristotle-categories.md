# Summary

In *Categories*, Aristotle uses linguistic structuring to enumerate the most general kinds of entities in reality. According to this investigation, the most basic explanatory entities (i.e., ontological bedrock) are the fundamental subjects of predication.

# Key terms

- **Category** = a (mode of) predication; how one term can be applied to another. To Aristotle, categories are the names that give the structure of facts.
- **Aristotle's fundamental (ontological) principle** = "the basic explanatory entities (i.e., explanatory *bedrock*) are the fundamental subjects of predication” (i.e., things that cannot be predicated any further). The key principle is that the thing *being predicated* is lower than the thing *predicated of*.
- Relations between names and “things”
	- **Homonymy** = same name, different account for that name (e.g., living horse and horse statue are both horse, yet *being* an horse is different for both)
	- **Synonymy** = same name, same account (e.g., man and living horse are both animal; being an animal is the same for both)
	- **Paronymy** = the name is derived from something else; its dependence on some subject is indicated by linguistic inflection (e.g., a brave person has brav*ery*)
- **Primary substance** = substance that is “numerically one and the same thing”

# Notes

- Aristotle studied with Plato, did some investigation into biology, then returned to Athens; *Categories* comes early in his career.
- Aristotle was motivated to write this text in response to [[plato-phaedo|Phaedo]]; Socrates’ “second sailing” never fully explains its logic of change.
