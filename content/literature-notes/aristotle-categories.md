# Summary

In *Categories*, Aristotle uses linguistic structuring to enumerate the most general kinds of entities in reality. According to this investigation, the most basic explanatory entities (i.e., ontological bedrock) are the fundamental subjects of predication.

# Key terms

- Relations between names and “things”
	- **Homonymy** = same name, different account for that name (e.g., living horse and horse statue are both horse, yet *being* an horse is different for both)
	- **Synonymy** = same name, same account (e.g., man and living horse are both animal; being an animal is the same for both)
	- **Paronymy** = the name is derived from something else; its dependence on some subject is indicated by linguistic inflection (e.g., a brave person has brav*ery*)
- **Primary substance** = substance that is “numerically one and the same thing”
