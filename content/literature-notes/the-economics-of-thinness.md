# Summary

[[2022-the-economist-the-economics-of-thinness]]

> It is economically rational for ambitious women to try as hard as possible to be thin.

Studies show that in rich countries, weight is negatively correlated with wealth for women, while no such association exists for men.

Women experience low self-esteem and pressure to be thin not merely because of “beauty standards,” but market incentives. In upper estimates, the wage premium imparted by going from obese to normal BMI is comparable to the premium imparted by getting a master’s degree. Further, fat women experience cumulative effects of discrimination over time, such as fewer opportunities for promotions. The effect may be even greater than measured, as studies cannot account for women who did not get jobs in the first place due to fatphobia.

Paradoxically, increase in obesity has led to increase in fatphobia in rich countries, possibly due to the perceived rarity of thinness. Such widespread trends indicate that obesity is not a choice. Nevertheless, women will continue to pursue thinness at their own expene.

# Notes

- Women, particularly wealthy women, are subjected to comments about weight and pressure to achieve a physical ideal.
	- Although women may receive messages of empowerment, that they have value beyond their size and beauty, evidence shows that weight correlates with wages and income.

>All women eventually recognise the importance placed upon their bodies. It is as though girls are walking through a forest unaware and are then shown the trees. They can wonder how the trees got there, how long they have been growing and how deep their roots really go. But there is little they can do about them and it is almost impossible to imagine the world any other way.

- In countries like the US, Britain, Germany, and South Korea, there is a negative correlation between measures of weight like BMI and income.
- Some argue that in the “rich world,” the link between poverty and obesity is because unhealthy foods are more accessible due to lower time and cost for preparation, or simply a lack of education about food quality.

> The problem with all of these explanations is that the correlation between income and weight at the population level in advanced countries is driven almost entirely by women.
## The duchess’s decree

>In other words, rich women are much thinner than poor women but rich men are about as fat as poor men.

- Other explanations for why only women are affected, such as more men in physically active jobs or more women explicitly thin in their roles, do not affect enough of the population to cause a substantial effect on wage differences.
- The effects may be understudied, as overweight women may not have the opportunity to earn wages in the same positions as thin women in the first place.
- In the highest estimates, a woman’s thinness is more important than getting additional education. [[It is economically rational for women to be thin]].
	- The “wage premium” for a master’s degree is 18 percent.
	- The premium for an obese woman to become “normal,” losing about 65 pounds, is 10 percent.
	- The effect is most significant for white women.
- Not only are their starting wages lower when controlling for other factors, fat women also experience cumulative effects of wage discrimination over their careers, receiving fewer wages and promotions.
- Paradoxically, the increase in fat people has led to increased stigma against fat people, possibly because thinness acquires the premium of rarity.
	- Harvard’s “implicit bias” test showed that while most negative associations with marginalized populations have decreased, weight is the exception.
- Women today experience low self-esteem and pressure to be thin not because of cultural messaging and standards, but also market incentives.

>Women accurately perceive that failing to lose weight or be thin will literally cost them.

- Interestingly, women seem to have accepted this fact decades ago, when fatphobia was more acceptable and explicit.

>“Even glossy women’s magazines now model scepticism toward top-down narratives about how we should look…but the psychological parasite of the ideal woman has evolved to survive in an ecosystem that pretends to resist her,” writes Jia Tolentino in her book “Trick Mirror”_._ Feminism “has not eradicated the tyranny of the ideal woman but, rather, has entrenched it and made it trickier.”

- Shame is not effective for weight loss because control over one’s weight is an illusion.
	- Individuals may gain or fail to lose weight due to medication or trauma responses.
	- In the 1980s, obesity rates skyrocketed for no apparent reason.

>Scientists are unsure of the answer (some point to the rise of processed foods) but they do agree that it is almost impossible to lose weight and stay smaller—and people who achieve this are far rarer than those who spend their lives trying, failing and blaming themselves.

## Too high a price

- The pursuit of thinness comes at the expense of other activities and overall enjoyment of life.
