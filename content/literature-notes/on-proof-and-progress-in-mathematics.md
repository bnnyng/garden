# Summary

[[1994-thurston-on-proof-and-progress-in-mathematics]]

Mathematics is defined recursively: one primary goal of mathemathicians is to advance human understanding of mathematical subjects, and communicate it effectively.

Understanding mathematics requires a number of cognitive abilities: human language; spatial and kinestheic awareness; logic and deduction; intuition, association, and metaphor; response to stimuli; and understanding processes over time.

Communication in a subfield is efficient because of shared patterns of thinking. Formalism provides a language for understanding mathematics to individuals outside the subfield.

# Notes

## What do mathematicians accomplish?

- Most broadly, mathematicians advance human understanding.
	- A computer-produced proof, despite being correct, led to controversy, suggesting that human understanding of the proof is key to mathematics.
- [[Mathematics is recursively defined]].

> The subject matter of mathematics changes to reflect how we think.

## How do people understand mathematics?

- Mathematical thinking requires [[The mind is comprised of interacting, interpretable modules|modular]] cognitive faculties.
- Mathematics is communicated by human language, and involves the associated abilities for speaking and understanding language, as well as reading and writing.
- Mathematical symbols are related to grammar.
- Our brainsâ€™ capacity for spatial awareness exceeds our capacity to communicate it.
- Formal proofs are based on intuition, and only later encoded.

## How is mathematical understanding communicated?

- [[Mathematical communication is most effective in subfields due to shared patterns of thinking]].
- The common language of mathematics, including symbols, definitions, and logic, does not communicate more nuanced modes of thinking which are automatically mentally translated by mathematicians.
