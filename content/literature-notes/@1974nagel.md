# Summary and thoughts

In this classic work of philosophy of mind, Nagel argues that subjective experiences, or what it is like to be a thing, have no objective nature that an external point of view can apprehend. Importantly, Nagel does not reject physical explanations of consciousness outright, but points out that physicalism is limited by the current gap between subjective and objective understandings.

This argument seems to *beg the question*: in the bat example, Nagel assumes fundamentally that the hard problem of consciousness exists in order to conclude…that the hard problem exists. Specifically, the claim that humans are limited by propositional concepts suggests that our inability to understand what it is like to be a bat comes from the *machinery*, or [[Algorithmic analysis reveals the formal processes which underlie a system’s visible behavior|algorithms]], we use to operate on our [[Knowledge-level analysis reveals general principles about a system’s significance or purpose|knowledge level representations]]; this assumes that algorithms on representations are indeed equivalent to subjective experience, but that is no more clear than the connection between [[Physical analysis concerns a system’s physical implementation or instantiation|physical level]] substrates of representations and consciousnesses that he is critiquing. Further, it is plausible to me that complex phenomena like consciousness can emerge from simple components like neurons, given the potential of [[Complex systems have nontrivial emergent and self-organizing behaviors|complex dynamics]]!

# Reconstruction

>An organism has conscious mental states if and only if there is something that it is like to be that organism—something it is like for the organism. We may call this the **subjective character of experience.**

**Physicalist theories** of consciousness, which reduce mental phenomena to processes in the brain, are not useful because we fundamentally cannot articulate what the subjective character of experience is. Thus, we cannot say what a physicalist theory needs to be a full account of consciousness. 

The example of being a bat illustrates the difference between subjective phenomena connected to individual points of view and objective facts:
1. Bats have experience. That is, there is *something that it is like to be a bat*.
2. Bats have very different activities and sensory abilities than humans.
3. We must extrapolate from human experience in order to imagine bat experience.
4. Our mental resources restrict our imagination to adding, subtracting, or modifying our present human experience.
5. Some bat actions that cannot be performed by humans, such as sonar perception, are not like anything that humans experience.
6. Hence, we cannot completely extrapolate what it is like for a bat to be a bat from human experience.
7. Hence, there exist facts beyond the reach of human concepts. Specifically, these facts cannot be expressed in *true propositions of a human language*.

>What is the relationship between concepts, essentially [[Representation is describing some aspect of reality with a useful symbol|representations]], and cognitive structure? Cognitive science fundamentally assumes a connection between physical and knowledge [[Information-processing systems are understood at knowledge, algorithm, and physical implementation levels|levels of explanation]].

Subjective experience can only be understood by individuals that share a point of view, while knowledge of objective facts can be observed by individuals from different points of view (see also: [[Mary's Room disproves a materialist basis for consciousness]]).

>There is a sense in which phenomenological facts are perfectly objective: one person can know or say of another what the quality of the other’s experience is. They are subjective, however, in the sense that even this objective ascription of experience is possible only for someone sufficiently similar to the object of ascription to be able to adopt his point of view—to understand the ascription in the first person as well as the third, so to speak.

Our understanding of certain things can move from subjective to objective, although it is unclear whether things have objective, intrinsic natures in themselves. For example, an organism may investigate and understand lightning without having human vision because lightning is external to a single point of view—it has a more objective character than a human visual perception. However, there is no such objective character in conscious experiences after removing the subjective point of view. Hence, we cannot reduce understanding of consciousness to something with a more objective physical nature.

>If mental processes are indeed physical processes, then there is something it is like intrinsically, to undergo certain physical processes. … At the present time the status of physicalism is similar to that which the hypothesis that matter is energy would have if uttered by a pre-Socratic philosopher. We do not have the beginnings of a conception of how it might be true.

Physical theories of mind are limited by the more general gap between subjective and objective. A possible solution is to develop a new system of “objective phenomenology” that does not depend on individual empathy or imagination. The goal of this new system would be to describe some part of the subjective character of experience to those incapable of having that experience, such as describing the experience of vision to a blind person.
