# Summary

In *Nichomachean Ethics*, Aristotle argues the highest practical human good is happiness, which is the well-living of a good life. In particular, human happiness is an activity that characterizes a good human life. The best human activity is the exercise of rational excellence, which comes in two forms: excellence of thinking, which requires theoretical wisdom; and excellence in feeling and acting, which requires practical wisdom.

The two modes of rational excellence correspond with the two happy lives: the political life and the contemplative life.
