In calculus, the following definition is used to define the [[The real numbers|real numbers]] as the unique [[Completeness|complete ordered field]].

>[!example] Definition: Isomorphism (calculus)
>An **isomorphism** between [[Order relations on sets and fields|ordered fields]] $\mathbb F_0, \mathbb F_1$ is a [[Algebra of functions|bijection]] $f : \mathbb F_0 \to \mathbb F_1$ such that:
>-  (a) $f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y)$
>- (b) $f(xy) = f(x)f(y)$
>- (c) $x<y \implies f(x) < f(y)$
