Hello! My name is Bonnie. I’m glad you’re here.

This website is a [garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) of my notes on various topics. I’ve taken up the horticultural metaphor because I like the notion of “tending” or “cultivating” knowledge, learning as a generative process. Currently, I am cleaning and organizing a two-year backlog of old notes, which will be published periodically. Feel free to explore as much or as little as you want.

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bonnie-yang-1198a522a/), [GitHub](https://github.com/by2328), and [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/liminaljest).
