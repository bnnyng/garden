Hello! My name is Bonnie. I’m glad you’re here.

This website is a [garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) of my notes on various topics. I like the metaphor “tending” or “cultivating” knowledge, learning as a generative process. Currently, I am cleaning up and organizing a two-year backlog of old notes, which will be published periodically. Feel free to explore as much or as little as you want.

(Tip: check the graph view.)
