According to philosopher Byung-Chul Han, the smartphone acts as a digital confessional. Like a rosary and beads, it is constantly within our grasp. Its status as a cult object enables “digital domination.” Unlike Christian confessionals, using the smartphone is an appeal for attention, not forgiveness.

>As a subjugation device, it acts like a rosary and its beads; this is how we keep a smartphone constantly at hand. The ‘like’ is a digital “amen.” We keep going to confession. We undress by choice. But we don’t ask for forgiveness: instead, we call out for attention.
