According to [[Han, Byung-Chul|Byung-Chul Han]], the smartphone acts as a digital confessional. Like a rosary and beads, it is constantly within our grasp. Its status as a cult object enables “digital domination.”

> As a subjugation device, it acts like a rosary and its beads; this is how we keep a smartphone constantly at hand. The ‘like’ is a digital “amen.” 

Unlike Christian confessionals, using the smartphone is an appeal for attention, not forgiveness.
