Author Ted Chiang presented the following claims during a talk for SFI’s [“Thought Experiments in Science and Fiction”](https://www.santafe.edu/events/thought-experiments-in-science-and-fiction) working group:
> - The learning gained by interacting with intelligent entities cannot be replicated by interacting with non-intelligent entities.
> - Life experience is incompressible. There are no shortcuts

Chiang believes that [[Embodied cognition|embodied]] life experience precedes the evolution of intelligence. To evolve intelligent artificial organisms, then, we need an online world that supports full embodied physics. 

This argument is rooted in **constructivism**, which is a theory of education where students actively construct knowledge through experiences, thereby building a unique body of knowledge. In contrast, the **transmission model of education** prioritizes the role of a teacher who passes a standardized body of knowledge to students who passively absorb information.
