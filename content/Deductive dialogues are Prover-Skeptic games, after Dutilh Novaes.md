[[2020-dutilh-novaes-dialogical-roots-of-deduction|Dutilh Novaes (2020)]] defines deductive dialogues as **Prover-Skeptic games.** The key distinction between the Prover-Skeptic and Prover-Refuter frameworks is that, unlike the Refuter that *actively* refutes the Prover, the Skeptic does not “lose” after being convinced by the Prover’s argument. (This framework is also more aligned with the Hegelian-dialectical perspective that the ultimate goal of the dialogue, or game, is to arrive at true belief. See also: [[Inquiry is the struggle to go from doubt to belief, after Peirce]].)

The requirements for a Skeptic to be persuaded by a proof depend on context, but include, minimally:
- **Accepting premises.** If the Skeptic admits *conditional* persuasion, then they must believe that the premises are important enough to establish a proof about.
- **Not having counterexamples.**
- **Being convinced by each step of the argument.** (See also: the requirement that deductive arguments have [[Three main features of deductive arguments, after Dutilh Novaes|stepwise perspicuity]].)
