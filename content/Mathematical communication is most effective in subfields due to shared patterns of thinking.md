> Within a subfield, people develop a body of common knowledge and known techniques. By informal contact, people learn to understand and copy each other's ways of thinking, so that ideas can be explained clearly and easily.

Subfields may even have shared language cues, similar to idioms, for particular concepts, mental images, and modes of thinking.
