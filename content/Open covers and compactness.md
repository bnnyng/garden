Compactness is a topological generalization of [[Closed sets, closures, and dense subsets|closed]] and [[Supremum and infimum|bounded]] sets in $\mathbb R$, and specifically the [[(Theorem) Heine-Borel|Heine-Borel]] property.

# Open coverings of a set

>[!example] Definition: Open cover
>An **open cover** of a set $E \subset X$ is a collection of [[Open sets|open sets]] such that $E$ is a subset of the collection. A **subcover** is a subset of the collection that also covers $E$.

# Compactness of sets and metric spaces

>[!example] Definition: Compact set
>A set $E \subset X$ is said to be **compact** if every open cover of $E$ has a finite subcover. 

We have the following results for general compact sets:
- (Rudin 2.34) Every compact set is closed.
- (Rudin 2.35) If $E$ is compact, and $F \subset E$ is a closed subset, then $F$ is compact.

>[!example] Definition: Compact metric spaces
>A [[Metrics and metric spaces|metric space]] $(X, d)$ is **compact** if $X$ is compact as a subset of $(X, d)$.

# Review

- Show that $(0, 1]$ is not compact. Is $[a, \infty)$ closed and/or compact?
