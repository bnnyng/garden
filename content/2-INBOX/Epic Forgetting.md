## Highlights
- AI is currently the most salient expression of what the [late David Golumbia](https://librarianshipwreck.wordpress.com/2023/09/18/in-memory-of-david-golumbia/) called “computationalism” — the idea that minds and computers are alike and that all thought is information processing, instrumental reason. “Despite being framed in terms of distributed power and democratic participation,” Golumbia argues, computationalism instead serves “the ends of entrenched power,” offering illusory and ideological experiences of individual mastery that mask the technology’s authoritarian implications.

- The labeling process could be understood as a form of reification, and, as Adorno put it in a letter to Benjamin, “all reification is a forgetting; objects become purely thing-like the moment they are retained for us without the continued presence of their other aspects, when something of them has been forgotten.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbtzn84269080b4f1cteect1))
- As a form of “supercharged bureaucracy,” in McQuillan’s terms, AI black-boxes authority, conceals the bases for the decisions it implements, and impedes accountability for those decisions, creating what he calls “algorithmic states of exception.” AI models presuppose that decision-making should be a closed process based on statistical inferences, implemented from the top down, rather than a process of debate that draws on or builds shared forms of experience and elicits active participation. In this respect, AI represents the very opposite of democratic processes or democratic life-forms. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbtzq294y094e0999rcgjavn))
