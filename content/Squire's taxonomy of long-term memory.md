Declarative, or explicit, memory involves facts and events that can be consciously retrieved and reported:
- [[Episodic memory stores knowledge of the world as an autobiographical representation]]

Non-declarative, or implicit, memory involves facts and associations which are retrieved through performance:
- Procedural memory is used in performing skills and behaviors
- Priming is when a behavior or mental act is enhanced by prior exposure
- Perceptual learning involves using perceptual cues to learn regularities in the environment
- [[Conditioning is the learned association between a behavior and an unrelated stimulus]]
- [[Non-associative learning is the systematic altering of behavior in response to a repeated stimulus]]
