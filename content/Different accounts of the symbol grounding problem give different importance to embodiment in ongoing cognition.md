In the “sensorimotor grounding” account, [[Embodied cognition|embodied cognition]] is directly used in ongoing cognition through sensorimotor-based concept representations.

In the “mental content externalism” account, embodiment and situatedness are not related to ongoing cognition; rather, relationships between physical body and mental representations are determined by factors like ecology and evolution.
