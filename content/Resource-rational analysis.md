>[!example] The six steps of rational analysis
>1. Precisely specify what the goals of the cognitive system are.
>2. Develop a formal model of the environment to which the system is adapted.
>3. Make the minimal assumptions about computational limitations.
>4. Derive the optimal behavioral function given (1) to (3).
>5. Examine the empirical literature to see if the predictions of the behavioral function are confirmed.
>6. If predictions are off, iterate.

>1. Begin with a [[Knowledge-level analysis reveals general principles about a system’s significance or purpose|computational-level]] (i.e., [[Classical theories of mind|functional]]) description of an aspect of cognition…
