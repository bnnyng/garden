According to [[2020-dutilh-novaes-dialogical-roots-of-deduction|Dutilh Novaes (2020)]], deductive arguments have three main aspects, in order of greatest to least importance:
- **Necessary truth-preservation** – if the premises are true, then the conclusion is *necessarily* true. It follows from truth-preservation that deductive arguments are also **monotonic**; that is, if $A \wedge B \implies C$, then adding an arbitrary inference $D$ does not block the existing inference.
- **Stepwise structure and perspicuity** – the connection between premises and conclusion is clear in such a way that the truth of the premises *guarantee* the truth of the conclusion; this implies the property of **transitivity**. What is considered a “clear” connection depends on audience and context.
- **Bracketing belief** – reasoners only consider connections between premises and conclusions, not the content of either themselves.
