Daniel Dennett captures this idea concisely: “Intelligence is knowing what to do when you don’t know what to do.” This separates intelligence from competency; an intelligent agent can reason about how to solve a problem without being able to actually implement the solution.

To make selecting heuristics more automatic, intelligent agents use an “oversimplify and self-monitor” strategy. That is, reflexive selection is paired with constant monitoring for possible failure modes.

However, Dennett does not believe such self-monitoring should be implemented in AI, which would be making AI reason more like humans. Instead, AI can be incorporated into extended human cognition: AI systems present candidate solutions and humans select them.
