Radical embodiment proposes an entirely new framework for cognitive science. While particular accounts of radical embodiment vary, they share the same principles:
- The traditional theory that cognition is based on representation is inadequate ([[Representation is describing some aspect of reality with a useful symbol]]);
- Understanding the relationship between intelligent systems, such as the brain ([[Cognitive science treats the brain as an information-processing system]]), with the body and environment requires new analytical tools;
- An explanation for cognition that involves elements from brain, body, and world is better than traditional theories of internal worlds and subsystems.
