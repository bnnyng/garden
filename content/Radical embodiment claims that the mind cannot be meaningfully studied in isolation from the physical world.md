A radically embodied framework extends the cognitive system to include aspects of the neural substrate, the body, and the surrounding environment [[@1999clark]]. While particular accounts of radical embodiment vary, they share the same principles:
- The traditional theory that cognition is based on [[Representation is describing some aspect of reality with a useful symbol|representation]] is inadequate;
- Understanding the relationship between intelligent systems, such as the [[Computationalist and connectionist approaches to cognition|brain]], with the body and environment requires new analytical tools;
- An explanation for cognition that involves elements from brain, body, and world is better than traditional theories of internal worlds and subsystems.
