>If $W \subset V$ is a [[Axioms for fields and vector spaces|subspace]] of a [[Bases and dimension|finite-dimensional]] vector space, then $\text{dim}(V) \leq \text{dim}(W)$. If $\text{dim}(V) = \text{dim}(W)$, then $W = V$. 

The [[Propositional logic|contrapositive]] states that if $W \subset V$ is a proper subspace, so $W \neq V$, then $\text{dim}(V) < \text{dim}(W)$ is a strict inequality.

We have the following corollary:
>If $\{v_1, \cdots, v_n\}$ is a set of [[Linear independence|linearly independent]] vectors in an in an $n$-dimensional vector space $V$, then $\{v_1, \cdots, v_n\}$ [[Linear combinations and spanning|spans]] $V$.
