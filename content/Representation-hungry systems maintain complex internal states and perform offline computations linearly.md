Representation-hungry information-processing systems maintain complex internal states and perform “offline” computations, which are detached from the present environment ([[Representation is describing some aspect of reality with a useful symbol]]).

In the traditional model of cognition, information processing is linear: the brain takes in sensory data, performs a complex computation to solve a problem, and instructs the body to take an action.
