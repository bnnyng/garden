Lex Friedman:
- Living objects are big in space, not time
- Made of all the causal structures (formalized by [[@2024wolpert|Wolpert & Kinney, 2024]])

- Imagination is “how deep in time you are”; imagination is a local boundary of what we know.
- Physical understanding is a product of time: learning, evolution, selection.
- [[Narratives become and make reality|Narratives]] are another technology, or evolved property.
