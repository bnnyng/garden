From Sara Walker’s talk at SFI:
- Imagination is “how deep in time you are”; imagination is a local boundary of what we know.
- Physical understanding is a product of time: learning, evolution, selection.
- [[Narratives become and make reality|Narratives]] are another technology, or evolved property.
