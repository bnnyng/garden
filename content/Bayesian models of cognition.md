According to [[Griffiths, Tom|Griffiths]] [et al. 2023](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.10206.pdf), Bayesian models of cognition are compatible with artificial neural networks because they define different [[Information-processing systems are understood at knowledge, algorithm, and physical implementation levels|levels of explanation]]. Bayesian models fall at the [[Knowledge-level analysis reveals general principles about a system’s significance or purpose|computational level]]—which is concerned with an agent’s abstract goals and solutions—for problems of learning and inductive reasoning, while ANNs implement an intelligent system at [[Algorithmic analysis reveals the formal processes which underlie a system’s visible behavior|algorithmic]] and [[Physical analysis concerns a system’s physical implementation or instantiation|physical]] levels.
