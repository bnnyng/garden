There are three properties that characterize all complex systems:
- Complex systems are made of relatively simple agents;
- Complex systems are **self-organized**, meaning they are able to organize their behavior without an internal or external “central executive”;
- Complex systems show **emergent** macroscopic behaviors that are hard to predict from individual components due to their **nonlinear** interaction. Examples of emergent properties include hierarchies, collective information processing, complex dynamics, and evolution and learning.

David Krakauer believes that a necessary condition of **complex adaptive systems** is that they encode or represent patterns of the world: “Everything adaptive has a model.” This enables complex adaptive systems to have goals and purpose (see [[Complexity is the study of teleonomic matter, after Krakauer]]).
