There are two properties that characterize all complex systems:
- [[Complex systems are self-organized]], meaning they are able to organize their behavior without an internal or external “central executive.”
- Complex systems show [[Emergent properties can only be understood at the system level|emergent]] *macroscopic* behaviors that are hard to predict from [[Complex systems are made of relatively simple agents|relatively simple individual components]]; this is because [[Components of a complex system interact nonlinearly]].
