There are three properties that characterize all complex systems:
- Complex systems are made of relatively simple agents;
- Complex systems are **self-organized**, meaning they are able to organize their behavior without an internal or external “central executive”;
- Complex systems show **emergent** macroscopic behaviors that are hard to predict from individual components due to their **nonlinear** interaction. Examples of emergent properties include hierarchies, collective information processing, complex dynamics, and evolution and learning.
