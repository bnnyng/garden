>[!example] Definition: Cauchy sequence

Cauchy sequences are closely related to [[Sequences|convergent sequences]]; however, a Cauchy sequence has terms that are getting closer and closer to each other, while a convergent sequence has terms that are approaching some fixed limit value.

# Review

- Prove or justify the following facts:
	- Cauchy sequences are [[Bounded sets|bounded]] (hint: choose $N$ that satisfies the definition of boundedness).
	- [[Sequences|Convergent sequences]] are Cauchy (hint: choose $N$ that satisfies the definition of Cauchy).
	- Cauchy does not imply convergence.
