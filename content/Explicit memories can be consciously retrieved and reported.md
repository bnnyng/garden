Explicit memory, also known as declarative memory, involves facts and events that can be consciously retrieved and reported. One type of explicit memory is semantic, or factual declarative, memory, which stores knowledge of the world in sentence-like forms. The other type of explicit memory is [[Episodic memory stores knowledge of the world as an autobiographical representation|episodic memory]], where autobiographical experienced events are stored in picture-like forms.
