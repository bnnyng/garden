# A note on ratings

My book ratings depend mostly on my personal whims and may have very little to do with the quality of the book itself:
- ⭐ – I did not like it. Doesn’t mean the book is poorly written, I simply did not enjoy reading it, or even regret the time I spent to finish it (I do not rate a book I have not read all the way through).
- ⭐⭐ – It was okay. Eh.
- ⭐⭐⭐ – I liked it or found it had interesting ideas, but I have no intention of rereading it or referencing it frequently.
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐ – Something about the book’s concepts, characterization, or prose was very compelling to me, or it changed my perspective in a meaningful way. I could see myself rereading it for its own sake, even if I do not gain any new knowledge.
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ – A favorite.

## 2024

#### *Mrs. Dalloway* by Virginia Woolf

Read 2024-02-22 – [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3971088804) – ⭐⭐⭐

My first truly modernist novel, or at least, that I can remember (according to the Goodreads records I read *To the Lighthouse* once, might as well have been in another life). Instead of being discrete, credible individuals, characters in *Mrs. Dalloway* spill into one another, and attributing an experience to a single character often feels like a game of catch-up.

Feeling indifferent toward the (in?)famous stream-of-consciousness style. There were many parts that did not engage me at all, but whenever I was tempted to set the book down, there would inevitably be a passage with words strung together in such a singular way that I had to read on.

I like what Eagleton says of Woolf’s characters in [[2013-eagleton-how-to-read-literature|How to Read Literature]]: “the self is just a bundle of chance sensations and perceptions, with only a vacancy at its core.” Clarissa does not need to act to fulfill a particular image to herself, others, and us readers. Only Septimus brings his inner narrative complexity to the physical world, and he is the most cohesive character by far, with an obvious origin (wartime traumas, inadequacy of mental health services in 20th century society) and evolution (spiraling to his own demise). Is it valid to define oneself by unused inclinations and potentials? To me, the fact that the characters in *Mrs. Dalloway* are so interchangeable, aside from the one guy who actually does things, suggests “no.”

#### *The Sea, the Sea* by Iris Murdoch

Read 2024-01-21 – [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5216501126) – ⭐⭐⭐⭐

The best book about food ever.

The first 100 pages are deceptively plausible. Around the time that other characters start literally appearing out of nowhere, sitcom-style, it becomes clear that every element of the novel, especially the main character Arrowby, is a surrogate for Murdoch’s moral and social philosophy. Like an overworked fable, both its literal content (a retired man pursues his childhood sweetheart) and themes (delusional love, fate and aging, unreliable narrator to the max) come off as trite. The novel goes on and on about the same details of Arrowby’s psyche (though it is his diary, to be fair) and glosses over, in my opinion, some of the most bizarre and thus interesting parts, like anything said or done by cousin James. Maybe that’s why I finished the second half so quickly—eager to move past the former and discover more of the latter. Somehow, it works wonderfully all together.

## 2023
#### *Atta* by Jarett Kobeck

Read 2023-12-30 – [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/6094187241) – ⭐⭐⭐⭐

This story is interesting to compare to the "speculative nonfiction" type book I am currently reading, *[[2020-labatut-when-we-cease-to-understand-the-world|When We Cease to Understand the World]]*, though this one leans more toward the speculation. The broad strokes of Atta's life, though, are mostly factual; every part of the "plot" is mentioned on his [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Atta).

Growing up after 9/11, I can't quite appreciate what cultural niche this book fills. The most obvious point is that Atta's religious fervor is riddled with contradictions, way too many to be worth listing. They are best summarized by Jarrah, an accomplice he hates for his "uncontrollable passion," when he tells Atta:

> [!quote]
> "You should not have forbid yourself the excesses of this strange world. You would know that cocaine and alcohol are the same thing. And expensive cars and luxury hotels are the same. And the love of a woman is the same. And so too is jihad. It's all drugs, brother, and I am an addict."

Atta has a vision of perfection for the world but a very poor understanding of reality itself (including, maybe as a literary device, poor theory of mind). His faith, like the Platonic-esque architectural forms of the ancient world, cannot be embodied. This book makes his mind somewhat tractable.

The Saddam Hussein story at the end was also nuts. I have nothing else to say.
