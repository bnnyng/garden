After Tomasello (1999) and Menary & Gillet (2017), human practices may develop at three distinct timescales: **phylogenetic**, **historical**, and **ontogenetic**. According to [[2020-dutilh-novaes-dialogical-roots-of-deduction|Dutilh Novaes (2020)]], “an encompassing account of a particular aspect of human cognition and the extent to which it is shaped by cultural processes must arguably tackle all three timescales.”
