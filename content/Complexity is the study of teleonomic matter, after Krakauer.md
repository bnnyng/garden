[According to David Krakauer](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/podcast/2023/07/10/242-david-krakauer-on-complexity-agency-and-information/), **complexity** is the study of **teleonomic matter**; that is, matter with purpose. Krakauer believes that a necessary condition of [[Complex systems have nontrivial emergent and self-organizing behaviors|complex systems]] is that they encode or represent patterns of the world.
