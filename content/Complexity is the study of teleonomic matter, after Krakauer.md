[According to David Krakauer](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/podcast/2023/07/10/242-david-krakauer-on-complexity-agency-and-information/), **complexity** is the study of **teleonomic matter**; that is, matter with purpose. Teleological explanations are made in terms of goals and functions:

>**Teleology** refers to a goal-oriented explanation, interpreting structures or dynamics in terms of their functions. In biological contexts, teleology is a consequence of natural selection, and in cultural contexts a result of learning and planning. Typically teleology implies internal states supporting **conditional branching**â€”pursuing different behaviors as a result of contingent history and context. [[@2024krakauer]]
