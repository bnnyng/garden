# In metric spaces

>[!example] Definition: Connected sets in metric spaces
>Given a [[Metrics, metric spaces, and the metric topology|metric space]] $(X, d)$, a subset $A \subseteq X$ is said to be **connected** if for all other (nonempty) subsets $U, V \in X$ where 
>$$
>\overline U \cap V = U \cap \overline V = \varnothing,
>$$
>we have $U \cup V \neq A$. The sets $U, V$ which satisfy the equality above are said to be **separated**; a subset is **connected** if it is not the union of two (nonempty) separated sets.
