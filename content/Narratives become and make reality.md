From Sara Walker’s talk at SFI:
- Imagination *causes* what will be built and lets us generate things.
- The universe we imagine is bigger than what the universe can actually construct.
- There is an “adjacent impossible” of things we cannot ever conceive of due to our evolution.
- Common take: life is “epiphenomenal.”
