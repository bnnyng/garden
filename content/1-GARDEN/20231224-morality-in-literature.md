Philip Roth is an ideal lens to analyze morality in literature, and perhaps creative media in general, through. Roth’s writing is often shockingly and repulsively misogynistic. In discussing how to interpret his works and legacy, [[Ottessa Moshfegh]] summarized neatly:

>“Whatever I find distasteful and embarrassing,” she said, “I feel it’s embarrassing for the author.”

However, essayist Hannah Gold notes that she often feels herself represented in the derogatory caricatures of Roth’s works, despite their influence on her intellectual and literary development. She believes that she, the female reader, bears the embarrassment and consequences, rather than Roth. 

Although I was captured my Moshfegh’s statement before, wanted to believe in its efficiency, I fear that it is not at all true.

But does this mean we need to buy in to censorship in the name of cultural sensitivity? Even more primarily, does an idea of upholding “right” culture even make sense, if we think [[Culture is arbitrary]]; is the censorship really leading to any improvements? Or does it diminish the value of literature as a whole? I think that depends on how we view the role of creative work.

From [Your Mind’s in the Hands of Everything](https://harpers.org/archive/2023/12/philip-roth-newark-your-minds-in-the-hands-of-everything/):
>This is, I suppose, my own ill-advised defense of literature, or at least my diagnosis of its challenges: that it is not moral instruction, nor a basic need akin to shelter and food, but rather a need like friends, adversaries, and love. Its function is social, even when we’re alone with it; it works only insofar as we can live with it, become vulnerable to it, or resist it.

More often than not, the media we consume serves as a creative compass. Not even for our own private navigation, but as a flag for other, the easier to distill and judge us with. Is this appropriate, or should we be seeking these works in solitude, as with Roth? Is it situation-dependent? Are we still able to enjoy things for ourselves, for their own sake, when distracted by the perception of others? Does it matter at all; is literature truly a social need?
