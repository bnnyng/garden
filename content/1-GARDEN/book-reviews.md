#### *Atta* by Jarett Kobeck

Read 2023-12-30 – [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/6094187241) 

This story is interesting to compare to the "speculative nonfiction" type book I am currently reading, *[[2020-labatut-when-we-cease-to-understand-the-world|When We Cease to Understand the World]]*, though this one leans more toward the speculation. The broad strokes of Atta's life, though, are mostly factual; every part of the "plot" is mentioned on his [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Atta).

Growing up after 9/11, I can't quite appreciate what cultural niche this book fills. The most obvious point is that Atta's religious fervor is riddled with contradictions, way too many to be worth listing. They are best summarized by Jarrah, an accomplice he hates for his "uncontrollable passion," when he tells Atta:

Atta has a vision of perfection for the world but a very poor understanding of reality itself (including, maybe as a literary device, poor theory of mind). His faith, like the Platonic-esque architectural forms of the ancient world, cannot be embodied. This book makes his mind somewhat tractable.

The Saddam Hussein story at the end was also nuts. I have nothing else to say.
