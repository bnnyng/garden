Because [[It is economically rational for women to be thin]], women in rich countries are in constant pursuit of thinness, engaging in behaviors to shape their bodies accordingly. This was once coupled with explicitly fatphobic attitudes, but today’s weight loss efforts are hidden under the guise of “wellness” and the body positivity narrative. 

This is a lot of time that women could spend on other things, like studying, having hobbies, and enjoying life. The cognitive diffraction experienced by women is far greater than men, whose every whim is accommodated and coddled by patriarchal scaffolding. This makes self-actualization near impossible for women.

How can women break free, if [[Hyperattention does not produce, but repeats what is already available]]? Is this why [[Modern feminism has made the “tyranny of the ideal woman” more subtle and ingrained]], rather than eradicating such oppressive standards? What do we fail to observe when we are being inundated with information?

If [[The contemplative life]] cannot be achieved by women entombed in our current social fabric, then the greatest human happiness cannot be achieved. I wish this were not so believable.
