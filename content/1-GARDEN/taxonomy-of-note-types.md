For me, the goal of writing and revising notes is to generate connections and identify areas of new research (see: [[20231225-my-workflow]]). This is a recursive process of:
- Highlighting as I read and importing direct passages into Obsidian from Readwise;
- Adding the most important works to my “raw” folder, then creating a literature note for each work that paraphrases the direct passages in my own words;
- Creating a permanent note for each *atomic* idea in the literature note, which link to other permanent notes as I find connections;
- Updating my [[Digital garden]] when my connections lead to a new idea or can be synthesized in an original way.

Permanent notes are the only notes in my vault that *do not follow a naming convention*. Most of my permanent notes will have titles that are complete propositions, and the body of a permanent note will be as precise as possible. However, permanent notes also include the following subtypes:
- Stubs defined implicitly through backlinks;
- “Topic” notes, typically created out of stubs, that contain a brief summary and primarily serve as maps of content for other notes (e.g., [[§ Linear algebra]]);
- “Definition” notes for technical terms or terms of art, which are different from topic notes in that they contain complete sentence descriptions (e.g., [[Dynamic coupling]], [[The contemplative life]]);
- “Bridge” notes which capture similarities and differences between two concepts;
- Other proper nouns, such as “person” notes, which are not concept-oriented.

My entire vault is related to the notion of a [[Complex system]], and the notes in my digital garden are its emergent properties ([[Components of a complex system interact nonlinearly]]). These garden notes are exploratory and evolve over time:
- 🌱 **Seeds** are rough, early ideas, or primarily works in progress;
- 🌿 **Budding** work has been somewhat edited and clarified, and is less frequently updated;
- 🌳 **Evergreen** notes are #wip
- Fruit
- Wilted

The notes in my digital garden are negatively defined: they include all the notes that I want to link to other atomic ideas, but unlike permanent notes, they are not drawn from a direct source.

The notes in my garden are also titled according to the date last updated, so I can quickly see which plants have been neglected. I intend to treat the garden as a writing inbox and flip through the notes regularly. It may be interesting to implement a spaced repetition system if I become very serious about developing each note in my garden, but for now, I prefer to update organically.

Finally, I have fleeting notes, which serve as a sort of ephemeral catch-all. These may include:
- Notes from lectures and classes;
- Scratchings and “brain dumps” that I write as a means to another end (e.g., overcoming writer’s block);
- Time-sensitive information that will become obsolete (e.g., job applications).
