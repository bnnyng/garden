In complexity science, linear systems are systems that can be understood as a whole by understanding the individual parts. The opposite of linear systems is [[Complex systems have nontrivial emergent and self-organizing behaviors|complex systems]], which exhibit emergent macroscopic behaviors due to nonlinear dynamics between individual agents.

Linearity is axiomatically defined in [[ยง Linear algebra]] via [[Axioms for fields and vector spaces]].
