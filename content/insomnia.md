Outline of main ideas:
- Not knowing how to handle myself when having insomnia, losing sense of autonomy; deeply humbling feeling of being out of control if I cannot engage in such an essential human need as sleep.
	- Despite all the sleep hygiene!
	- Betrayal of my body that I’ve gotten used to.
- A brief history of my insomnia in college. Psychosomatic and physiological.
- The inertia of being longer awake, more difficult to sleep.
- Rarely feeling altogether used to my own mind. Insomnia being just one mind-altering substance. And I won’t be for a while, due to indefinite antidepressant use. 
	- Not knowing what it feels like to not have something go wrong. I am always too tired, too unmotivated, too dialed in, mind is drawing too many blanks.
- Interesting vs. uninteresting lives of people with insomnia.
	- Slightly different from being merely exemplary, Weil gives a comforting cosmology of affliction. It is nice to consider that my suffering has meaning.
- Maybe I have insomnia because the world is too large, I need to either cut it down or give myself more time to take it in. A failure of my own memory consolidation

Outline of sections:
- Journalistic entry, physical experience
- Personal history, what I did on those insomniac nights
- Greater social contexts; headaches, cognitive suffering
- Speculations on my own cognition
