>[!example] Definition: Subspace (induced) topology
>Given a topological space $(X, \mathcal T)$ and a subset $A \subseteq X$, the **subspace** or **induced** topology on $A$ is defined by the collection
>$$
>\mathcal T_A =  \{ A \cap U \ | \ U \in \mathcal T\}.
>$$
>In other words, open sets in $A$ (i.e., a subset of $A$ that is open in the subset topology) are obtained by intersecting $A$ with open sets of $X$ (i.e., an open set in $(X, \mathcal T$)).

# Review

- Give an example where a subset is open in $A \subset X$ but not in $X$.
- Prove the lemma about a basis for a subspace topology. ‚≠ê
