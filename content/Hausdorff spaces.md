**Hausdorff spaces** impose an additional constraint on an arbitrary [[Topological spaces and open sets|topological space]] so that [[Sequences#In topological spaces|sequences]] converge to one point (i.e., one-point sets are [[Closed sets, closures, and dense subsets#In topological spaces|closed]]).

>[!example] Definition: Hausdorff space
>A topological space $X$ is called a **Hausdorff space** if for each pair of distinct points $x_1, x_2 \in X$, there exist neighborhoods $U_1, U_2$ of $x_1, x_2$, respectively, such that $U_1 \cap U_2 = \varnothing$.
