Representation is describing some aspect of reality with a useful symbol ([[@1982marr|Marr, 1982]]) More precisely, representation includes the set of symbols along with rules that determine how the representations are applied to a particular entity.

Classical theories of [[Computationalist and connectionist approaches to cognition|cognitive science treat the brain as an information-processing system]]; intelligent systems have a rich internal world of such symbols to represent external objects and environments. Such theories assume that information-processing systems are [[Representation-hungry systems maintain complex internal states and perform offline computations linearly|representation-hungry]].

Whether representations have some relationship with [[ยง Intelligence]] is an ongoing debate.
