Representation is describing some aspect of reality with a useful symbol ([[@1982marr|Marr, 1982]]). More precisely, representation includes the set of symbols along with rules that determine how the representations are applied to a particular entity.

Classical theories of cognitive science treat the brain as an [[Computationalist and connectionist approaches to cognition|information-processing system]]; that is, intelligent systems need a rich internal world of symbols to represent external objects and environments. This “computationalist” theory assumes that information-processing systems are [[Representation-hungry systems maintain complex internal states and perform offline computations linearly|representation-hungry]].

It has also been theorized since antiquity—see Aristotle’s signet ring—that [[Reality is mediated by our mental models]]. Whether these models or representations have some relationship with [[§ Intelligence]] is an ongoing debate.
