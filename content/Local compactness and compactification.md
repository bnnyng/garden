>[!example] Definition: Local compactness
>A [[Topological spaces and open sets|topological space]] $X$ is locally compact at a point $x \in X$ if there exists a [[Compactness|compact]] subspace $C \subseteq X$ and a neighborhood $U$ of $x$ such that $U \subseteq C$. We say $X$ is **locally compact** if this holds for all $x \in X$.

# Examples

- $\mathbb R^n$
- Non-examples: rationals as subset of R, infinite product with any topology because open sets too big.
