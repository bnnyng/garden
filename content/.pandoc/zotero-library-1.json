Previous studies suggest that psilocybin may decrease depression and anxiety in cancer patients. The effects of psilocybin were studied in 51 cancer patients with life-threatening diagnoses and symptoms of depression and/or anxiety. This randomized, double-blind, cross-over trial investigated the effects of a very low (placebo-like) dose (1 or 3 mg/70 kg) vs. a high dose (22 or 30 mg/70 kg) of psilocybin administered in counterbalanced sequence with 5 weeks between sessions and a 6-month follow-up. Instructions to participants and staff minimized expectancy effects. Participants, staff, and community observers rated participant moods, attitudes, and behaviors throughout the study. High-dose psilocybin produced large decreases in clinician- and self-rated measures of depressed mood and anxiety, along with increases in quality of life, life meaning, and optimism, and decreases in death anxiety. At 6-month follow-up, these changes were sustained, with about 80% of participants continuing to show clinically significant decreases in depressed mood and anxiety. Participants attributed improvements in attitudes about life/self, mood, relationships, and spirituality to the high-dose experience, with >80% endorsing moderately or greater increased well-being/life satisfaction. Community observer ratings showed corresponding changes. Mystical-type psilocybin experience on session day mediated the effect of psilocybin dose on therapeutic outcomes., \nTrial Registration\n, ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00465595","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Griffiths","given":"Roland R"},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Matthew W"},{"family":"Carducci","given":"Michael A"},{"family":"Umbricht","given":"Annie"},{"family":"Richards","given":"William A"},{"family":"Richards","given":"Brian D"},{"family":"Cosimano","given":"Mary P"},{"family":"Klinedinst","given":"Margaret A"}],"citation-key":"2016griffiths","container-title":"Journal of Psychopharmacology (Oxford, England)","container-title-short":"J Psychopharmacol","DOI":"10.1177/0269881116675513","ISSN":"0269-8811","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",12]]},"page":"1181-1197","PMCID":"PMC5367557","PMID":"27909165","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Psilocybin produces substantial and sustained decreases in depression and anxiety in patients with life-threatening cancer","title-short":"Psilocybin produces substantial and sustained decreases in depression and anxiety in patients with life-threatening cancer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5367557/","volume":"30"},{"id":"1995stillings","abstract":"Cognitive Science is a single-source undergraduate text that broadly surveys the theories and empirical results of cognitive science within a consistent computational perspective.

Their linguistic ability is interwoven with other cognitive abilities. Tomasello argues that the essence of language is its symbolic dimension, which rests on the uniquely human ability to comprehend intention. Grammar emerges as the speakers of a language create linguistic constructions out of recurring sequences of symbols; children pick up these patterns in the buzz of words they hear around them. All theories of language acquisition assume these fundamental skills of intention-reading and pattern-finding. Some formal linguistic theories posit a second set of acquisition processes to connect somehow with an innate universal grammar. But these extra processes, Tomasello argues, are completely unnecessary—important to save a theory but not to explain the phenomenon.

The relationship between thyroid hormones and nutritional status in humans has been assessed primarily in drastic dietary or bariatric surgery interventions, while limited information is available on serial assessment of this axis during moderate, prolonged dietary restriction., Methods: To evaluate the effects of moderate dietary restriction on thyroid hormone homeostasis, 47 subjects with a body mass index (BMI) of 25–45 kg/m2 were enrolled in a longitudinal intervention study; 30 nonoverweight volunteers were also enrolled as controls. Overweight and obese subjects underwent a 12-month individualized dietary intervention aimed at achieving a 5–10% weight loss., Results: The intervention resulted in a 6.3±0.9 kg (6.5±1.0%) weight loss. At baseline, thyrotropin (TSH) and T3 concentrations correlated significantly with fat mass (R=0.257, p=0.024 and R=0.318, p=0.005, respectively). After weight loss, T3 decreased significantly (from 112.7±3.1 to 101.8±2.6 ng/dL, p<0.001) in the absence of significant changes in TSH or free T4 (fT4). The decrease in serum T3 correlated with the decrease in weight (R=0.294, p<0.001). The T3:fT4 ratio decreased significantly (p=0.02) in individuals who lost >5% body weight., Conclusions: T3 concentration closely correlates with individual nutritional status, and moderate weight loss results in a decrease in T3 with minimal changes in other thyroid hormone homeostasis parameters. The data suggest that a decrease in peripheral conversion of the prohormone T4 into its hormonally active metabolite T3 is at least in part responsible for the observed changes in thyroid hormone homeostasis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Agnihothri","given":"Ritesh V."},{"family":"Courville","given":"Amber B."},{"family":"Linderman","given":"Joyce D."},{"family":"Smith","given":"Sheila"},{"family":"Brychta","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Remaley","given":"Alan"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Kong Y."},{"family":"Simchowitz","given":"Louis"},{"family":"Celi","given":"Francesco S."}],"citation-key":"2014agnihothri","container-title":"Thyroid","container-title-short":"Thyroid","DOI":"10.1089/thy.2013.0055","ISSN":"1050-7256","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",1,1]]},"page":"19-26","PMCID":"PMC3887425","PMID":"23902316","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Moderate Weight Loss Is Sufficient to Affect Thyroid Hormone Homeostasis and Inhibit Its Peripheral Conversion","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3887425/","volume":"24"},{"id":"treil","author":[{"family":"Treil","given":"Sergei"}],"citation-key":"treil","language":"en","page":"286","source":"Zotero","title":"Linear Algebra Done Wrong","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"2015strahlerrivero","abstract":"Empirical research studies have highlighted the need to investigate whether video game can be useful as a tool within a neuropsychological rehabilitation program for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) patients.

A total of 14 empirical studies meeting the inclusion criteria were identified. The studies reported the attention, working memory, and the behavioral aspects as the main target of the intervention. Cognitive and behavioral gains were reported after the video game training (VGT). However, many bias related to the choice of outcome instruments, sampling and blindness of assessors, weaken the results power. Additional researches are important to clarify the effects and stability of the VGT programs, and an important effort should be made to construct better methods to assess improvements on everyday cognitive abilities and real world functioning.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Strahler Rivero","given":"Thiago"},{"family":"Herrera Nuñez","given":"Lina Maria"},{"family":"Uehara Pires","given":"Emmy"},{"family":"Amodeo Bueno","given":"Orlando Francisco"}],"citation-key":"2015strahlerrivero","container-title":"Frontiers in Psychiatry","ISSN":"1664-0640","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"source":"Frontiers","title":"ADHD Rehabilitation through Video Gaming: A Systematic Review Using PRISMA Guidelines of the Current Findings and the Associated Risk of Bias","title-short":"ADHD Rehabilitation through Video Gaming","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2015.00151","volume":"6"},{"id":"2020waltz","abstract":"The prescription-only game is said to improve attention function in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Waltz","given":"Emily"}],"citation-key":"2020waltz","container-title":"Nature Biotechnology","DOI":"10.1038/s41587-020-0726-6","ISSN":"1546-1696","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,1]]},"language":"en","license":"2020 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","number":"11","page":"1224-1225","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"First video game to treat disease gains FDA okay","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0726-6","volume":"38"},{"id":"2017mueller","abstract":"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a complex condition with a heterogeneous presentation.

AKL-T01 is an investigational digital therapeutic designed to target attention and cognitive control delivered through a video game-like interface via at-home play for 25 min per day, 5 days per week for 4 weeks. This study aimed to assess whether AKL-T01 improved attentional performance in paediatric patients with ADHD.\nMethods\nThe Software Treatment for Actively Reducing Severity of ADHD (STARS-ADHD) was a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, controlled trial of paediatric patients (aged 8–12 years, without disorder-related medications) with confirmed ADHD and Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA) Attention Performance Index (API) scores of −1·8 and below done by 20 research institutions in the USA. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to AKL-T01 or a digital control intervention. The primary outcome was mean change in TOVA API from pre-intervention to post-intervention.

We propose a taxonomy based on the types of information that attention operates over—the targets of attention. At the broadest level, the taxonomy distinguishes between external attention and internal attention. External attention refers to the selection and modulation of sensory information. External attention selects locations in space, points in time, or modality-speciﬁc input. Such perceptual attention can also select features deﬁned across any of these dimensions, or object representations that integrate over space, time, and modality. Internal attention refers to the selection, modulation, and maintenance of internally generated information, such as task rules, responses, long-term memory, or working memory. Working memory, in particular, lies closest to the intersection between external and internal attention.

The first is understanding the conditions that determine to what extent a system has conscious experience. For instance, why is our consciousness generated by certain parts of our brain, such as the thalamocortical system, and not by other parts, such as the cerebellum? And why are we conscious during wakefulness and much less so during dreamless sleep? The second problem is understanding the conditions that determine what kind of consciousness a system has. For example, why do specific parts of the brain contribute specific qualities to our conscious experience, such as vision and audition?\n\nPresentation of the hypothesis\nThis paper presents a theory about what consciousness is and how it can be measured. According to the theory, consciousness corresponds to the capacity of a system to integrate information. This claim is motivated by two key phenomenological properties of consciousness: differentiation – the availability of a very large number of conscious experiences; and integration – the unity of each such experience. The theory states that the quantity of consciousness available to a system can be measured as the Φ value of a complex of elements. Φ is the amount of causally effective information that can be integrated across the informational weakest link of a subset of elements. A complex is a subset of elements with Φ>0 that is not part of a subset of higher Φ. The theory also claims that the quality of consciousness is determined by the informational relationships among the elements of a complex, which are specified by the values of effective information among them. Finally, each particular conscious experience is specified by the value, at any given time, of the variables mediating informational interactions among the elements of a complex.\n\nTesting the hypothesis\nThe information integration theory accounts, in a principled manner, for several neurobiological observations concerning consciousness. As shown here, these include the association of consciousness with certain neural systems rather than with others; the fact that neural processes underlying consciousness can influence or be influenced by neural processes that remain unconscious; the reduction of consciousness during dreamless sleep and generalized seizures; and the time requirements on neural interactions that support consciousness.\n\nImplications of the hypothesis\nThe theory entails that consciousness is a fundamental quantity, that it is graded, that it is present in infants and animals, and that it should be possible to build conscious artifacts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Tononi","given":"Giulio"}],"citation-key":"2004tononi","container-title":"BMC Neuroscience","container-title-short":"BMC Neurosci","DOI":"10.1186/1471-2202-5-42","ISSN":"1471-2202","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004",11,2]]},"page":"42","PMCID":"PMC543470","PMID":"15522121","source":"PubMed Central","title":"An information integration theory of consciousness","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC543470/","volume":"5"},{"id":"2022toumi","abstract":"This thesis introduces quantum natural language processing (QNLP) models based on a simple yet powerful analogy between computational linguistics and quantum mechanics: grammar as entanglement. The grammatical structure of text and sentences connects the meaning of words in the same way that entanglement structure connects the states of quantum systems. Category theory allows to make this language-to-qubit analogy formal: it is a monoidal functor from grammar to vector spaces. We turn this abstract analogy into a concrete algorithm that translates the grammatical structure onto the architecture of parameterised quantum circuits. We then use a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm to train the model so that evaluating the circuits computes the meaning of sentences in data-driven tasks. The implementation of QNLP models motivated the development of DisCoPy (Distributional Compositional Python), the toolkit for applied category theory of which the first chapter gives a comprehensive overview. String diagrams are the core data structure of DisCoPy, they allow to reason about computation at a high level of abstraction. We show how they can encode both grammatical structures and quantum circuits, but also logical formulae, neural networks or arbitrary Python code. Monoidal functors allow to translate these abstract diagrams into concrete computation, interfacing with optimised task-specific libraries. The second chapter uses DisCopy to implement QNLP models as parameterised functors from grammar to quantum circuits. It gives a first proof-of-concept for the more general concept of functorial learning: generalising machine learning from functions to functors by learning from diagram-like data. In order to learn optimal functor parameters via gradient descent, we introduce the notion of diagrammatic differentiation: a graphical calculus for computing the gradients of parameterised diagrams.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Toumi","given":"Alexis"}],"citation-key":"2022toumi","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2212.06615","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,13]]},"number":"arXiv:2212.06615","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Category Theory for Quantum Natural Language Processing","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06615"},{"id":"2008spivak","abstract":"Pt. 1.

Recent findings in network neuroscience, however, challenge this assumption, providing evidence that general intelligence may depend on system-wide network mechanisms, suggesting that local representations are necessary but not sufficient to account for the neural architecture of human intelligence. Despite the importance of this key theoretical distinction, prior research has not systematically investigated the role of local versus global neural representations in predicting general intelligence. We conducted a large-scale connectome-based predictive modeling study (N = 297), administering resting-state fMRI and a comprehensive cognitive battery to evaluate the efficacy of modern neuroscientific theories of human intelligence, including spatially localized theories (Lateral Prefrontal Cortex Theory, Parieto-Frontal Integration Theory, and Multiple Demand Theory) and recent global accounts (Process Overlap Theory and Network Neuroscience Theory). The results of our study demonstrate that general intelligence can be predicted by local functional connectivity profiles but is most robustly explained by global profiles of whole-brain connectivity. Our findings further suggest that the improved efficacy of global theories is not reducible to a greater strength or number of connections, but instead results from considering both strong and weak connections that provide the basis for intelligence (as predicted by the Network Neuroscience Theory). Our results highlight the importance of considering local neural representations in the context of a global information-processing architecture, suggesting future directions for theory-driven research on system-wide network mechanisms underlying general intelligence.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Anderson","given":"Evan D."},{"family":"Barbey","given":"Aron K."}],"citation-key":"anderson","container-title":"Human Brain Mapping","DOI":"10.1002/hbm.26164","ISSN":"1097-0193","issue":"n/a","language":"en","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Investigating cognitive neuroscience theories of human intelligence: A connectome-based predictive modeling approach","title-short":"Investigating cognitive neuroscience theories of human intelligence","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hbm.26164","volume":"n/a"},{"id":"hubbard","author":[{"family":"Hubbard","given":""}],"citation-key":"hubbard","title":"Vector calculus, linear algebra, and differential forms, Solution manual","type":"book"},{"id":"1999hubbard","author":[{"family":"Hubbard","given":"John H."},{"family":"Hubbard","given":"Barbara Burke"}],"call-number":"QA303 .H79 1999","citation-key":"1999hubbard","event-place":"Upper Saddle River, N.J","ISBN":"978-0-13-657446-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999"]]},"number-of-pages":"688","publisher":"Prentice Hall","publisher-place":"Upper Saddle River, N.J","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Vector calculus, linear algebra, and differential forms: a unified approach","title-short":"Vector calculus, linear algebra, and differential forms","type":"book"},{"id":"1997judson","author":[{"family":"Judson","given":"Thomas W."}],"citation-key":"1997judson","event-place":"Richmond, VA","ISBN":"978-0-9824062-5-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["1997"]]},"language":"eng","note":"OCLC: 1250465187","publisher":"Virginia Commenwealth University","publisher-place":"Richmond, VA","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Abstract algebra: theory and applications","title-short":"Abstract algebra","type":"book"},{"id":"20rudin","author":[{"family":"Rudin","given":"Walter"}],"citation-key":"20rudin","collection-title":"International series in pure and applied mathematics","edition":"3. ed., [Nachdr.]","event-place":"Auckland","ISBN":"978-0-07-085613-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["20"]]},"language":"eng","number-of-pages":"342","publisher":"McGraw-Hill","publisher-place":"Auckland","source":"K10plus ISBN","title":"Principles of mathematical analysis","type":"book"},{"id":"snyder","author":[{"family":"Snyder","given":"Richard"}],"citation-key":"snyder","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"The Human Dimension of Comparative Research","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"1983tilly","author":[{"family":"Tilly","given":"Charles"}],"citation-key":"1983tilly","issued":{"date-parts":[["1983"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"7 War Making and State Making as Organized Crime","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"1993odonnell","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,18]]},"author":[{"family":"O'Donnell","given":"Guillermo"}],"citation-key":"1993odonnell","container-title":"World Development","container-title-short":"World Development","DOI":"10.1016/0305-750X(93)90048-E","ISSN":"0305750X","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["1993",8]]},"language":"en","page":"1355-1369","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"On the state, democratization and some conceptual problems: A Latin American view with glances at some postcommunist countries","title-short":"On the state, democratization and some conceptual problems","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0305750X9390048E","volume":"21"},{"id":"2003brinks","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Brinks","given":"Daniel M."}],"citation-key":"2003brinks","container-title":"Comparative Politics","container-title-short":"Comparative Politics","DOI":"10.2307/4150157","ISSN":"00104159","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",10]]},"language":"en","page":"1","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Informal Institutions and the Rule of Law: The Judicial Response to State Killings in Buenos Aires and Sao Paulo in the 1990s","title-short":"Informal Institutions and the Rule of Law","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/4150157?origin=crossref","volume":"36"},{"id":"2016devore","author":[{"family":"Devore","given":"Jay L."}],"call-number":"QA273 .D46 2016","citation-key":"2016devore","edition":"Ninth edition","event-place":"Boston, MA","ISBN":"978-1-305-25180-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"number-of-pages":"715","publisher":"Cengage Learning","publisher-place":"Boston, MA","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Probability and statistics for engineering and the sciences","type":"book"},{"id":"2016firestone","abstract":"What determines what we see? In contrast to the traditional \"modular\" understanding of perception, according to which visual processing is encapsulated from higher-level cognition, a tidal wave of recent research alleges that states such as beliefs, desires, emotions, motivations, intentions, and linguistic representations exert direct, top-down influences on what we see. There is a growing consensus that such effects are ubiquitous, and that the distinction between perception and cognition may itself be unsustainable. We argue otherwise: None of these hundreds of studies - either individually or collectively - provides compelling evidence for true top-down effects on perception, or \"cognitive penetrability.\" In particular, and despite their variety, we suggest that these studies all fall prey to only a handful of pitfalls. And whereas abstract theoretical challenges have failed to resolve this debate in the past, our presentation of these pitfalls is empirically anchored: In each case, we show not only how certain studies could be susceptible to the pitfall (in principle), but also how several alleged top-down effects actually are explained by the pitfall (in practice). Moreover, these pitfalls are perfectly general, with each applying to dozens of other top-down effects. We conclude by extracting the lessons provided by these pitfalls into a checklist that future work could use to convincingly demonstrate top-down effects on visual perception. The discovery of substantive top-down effects of cognition on perception would revolutionize our understanding of how the mind is organized; but without addressing these pitfalls, no such empirical report will license such exciting conclusions.","author":[{"family":"Firestone","given":"Chaz"},{"family":"Scholl","given":"Brian J."}],"citation-key":"2016firestone","container-title":"The Behavioral and Brain Sciences","container-title-short":"Behav Brain Sci","DOI":"10.1017/S0140525X15000965","ISSN":"1469-1825","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",1]]},"language":"eng","page":"e229","PMID":"26189677","source":"PubMed","title":"Cognition does not affect perception: Evaluating the evidence for \"top-down\" effects","title-short":"Cognition does not affect perception","type":"article-journal","volume":"39"},{"id":"2010guillemin","abstract":"Advancing research.

Arguments are highly speculative, for the causal pathways are usually diﬃcult to measure and are not readily testable in a large-N cross-country format.

This explanation correctly predicts that suppression is monocular, immune to cortical adaptation, and occurs for mask stimuli that elicit responses in the thalamus but not in the cortex. Depression also explains other phenomena previously ascribed to intracortical inhibition. It explains why responses saturate at high stimulus contrast, whereas selectivity for orientation and spatial frequency is invariant with contrast. It explains why transient responses to flashed stimuli are nonlinear, whereas spatial summation is primarily linear.

Here, we connect these lines of inquiry to demonstrate that a network's reliance on single directions is a good predictor of its generalization performance, across networks trained on datasets with different fractions of corrupted labels, across ensembles of networks trained on datasets with unmodified labels, across different hyperparameters, and over the course of training. While dropout only regularizes this quantity up to a point, batch normalization implicitly discourages single direction reliance, in part by decreasing the class selectivity of individual units. Finally, we find that class selectivity is a poor predictor of task importance, suggesting not only that networks which generalize well minimize their dependence on individual units by reducing their selectivity, but also that individually selective units may not be necessary for strong network performance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Morcos","given":"Ari S."},{"family":"Barrett","given":"David G.

We claim that what makes a system intelligible is an understanding of the dependencies between its behavior and the factors that are causally responsible for that behavior. In biological systems, many of these dependencies are naturally \"top-down\": ethological imperatives interact with evolutionary and developmental constraints under natural selection. We describe how the optimization techniques used to construct NN models capture some key aspects of these dependencies, and thus help explain why brain systems are as they are -- because when a challenging ecologically-relevant goal is shared by a NN and the brain, it places tight constraints on the possible mechanisms exhibited in both kinds of systems.

The automatic discovery of algorithms using machine learning offers the prospect of reaching beyond human intuition and outperforming the current best human-designed algorithms. However, automating the algorithm discovery procedure is intricate, as the space of possible algorithms is enormous. Here we report a deep reinforcement learning approach based on AlphaZero1 for discovering efficient and provably correct algorithms for the multiplication of arbitrary matrices. Our agent, AlphaTensor, is trained to play a single-player game where the objective is finding tensor decompositions within a finite factor space. AlphaTensor discovered algorithms that outperform the state-of-the-art complexity for many matrix sizes. Particularly relevant is the case of 4 × 4 matrices in a finite field, where AlphaTensor’s algorithm improves on Strassen’s two-level algorithm for the first time, to our knowledge, since its discovery 50 years ago2. We further showcase the flexibility of AlphaTensor through different use-cases: algorithms with state-of-the-art complexity for structured matrix multiplication and improved practical efficiency by optimizing matrix multiplication for runtime on specific hardware. Our results highlight AlphaTensor’s ability to accelerate the process of algorithmic discovery on a range of problems, and to optimize for different criteria.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Fawzi","given":"Alhussein"},{"family":"Balog","given":"Matej"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Aja"},{"family":"Hubert","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Romera-Paredes","given":"Bernardino"},{"family":"Barekatain","given":"Mohammadamin"},{"family":"Novikov","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"R.

Instead, we take inspiration from the philosophy of science, and in particular from Lakatos, who showed that the core of a scientific research programme is often not directly falsifiable but should be assessed by its capacity to generate novel insights. Following this view, we present neuroconnectionism as a general research programme centred around ANNs as a computational language for expressing falsifiable theories about brain computation. We describe the core of the programme, the underlying computational framework and its tools for testing specific neuroscientific hypotheses and deriving novel understanding.

Although existing models aid our knowledge of critical aspects of VPL, the connections shown by these models between behavioral learning and plasticity across different brain areas are typically superficial. Most models explain VPL as readout from simple perceptual representations to decision areas and are not easily adaptable to explain new findings. Here, we show that a well -known instance of deep neural network (DNN), whereas not designed specifically for VPL, provides a computational model of VPL with enough complexity to be studied at many levels of analyses. After learning a Gabor orientation discrimination task, the DNN model reproduced key behavioral results, including increasing specificity with higher task precision, and also suggested that learning precise discriminations could transfer asymmetrically to coarse discriminations when the stimulus conditions varied. Consistent with the behavioral findings, the distribution of plasticity moved toward lower layers when task precision increased and this distribution was also modulated by tasks with different stimulus types. Furthermore, learning in the network units demonstrated close resemblance to extant electrophysiological recordings in monkey visual areas. Altogether, the DNN fulfilled predictions of existing theories regarding specificity and plasticity and reproduced findings of tuning changes in neurons of the primate visual areas. Although the comparisons were mostly qualitative, the DNN provides a new method of studying VPL, can serve as a test bed for theories, and assists in generating predictions for physiological investigations.\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Visual perceptual learning (VPL) has been found to cause changes at multiple stages of the visual hierarchy. We found that training a deep neural network (DNN) on an orientation discrimination task produced behavioral and physiological patterns similar to those found in human and monkey experiments. Unlike existing VPL models, the DNN was pre-trained on natural images to reach high performance in object recognition, but was not designed specifically for VPL; however, it fulfilled predictions of existing theories regarding specificity and plasticity and reproduced findings of tuning changes in neurons of the primate visual areas. When used with care, this unbiased and deep-hierarchical model can provide new ways of studying VPL from behavior to physiology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Wenliang","given":"Li K."},{"family":"Seitz","given":"Aaron R."}],"citation-key":"2018wenliang","container-title":"Journal of Neuroscience","container-title-short":"J.

Our results parallel those recently published by Morcos et al., indicating that class selectivity is not a good indicator for classification performance.

To solve these problems, we propose a method to transfer knowledge independently of the spatial shape of the teacher’s feature map, which is major information obtained by decomposing the feature map through singular value decomposition (SVD). In addition, we present a multitask learning method that enables the student to learn the teacher’s knowledge effectively by adaptively adjusting the teacher’s constraints to the student’s learning speed.

Analyzing the internal representation structure of ViTs and CNNs on image classification benchmarks, we find striking differences between the two architectures, such as ViT having more uniform representations across all layers. We explore how these differences arise, finding crucial roles played by self-attention, which enables early aggregation of global information, and ViT residual connections, which strongly propagate features from lower to higher layers. We study the ramifications for spatial localization, demonstrating ViTs successfully preserve input spatial information, with noticeable effects from different classification methods.

It is the hierarchical Transformers (e.g., Swin Transformers) that reintroduced several ConvNet priors, making Transformers practically viable as a generic vision backbone and demonstrating remarkable performance on a wide variety of vision tasks. However, the effectiveness of such hybrid approaches is still largely credited to the intrinsic superiority of Transformers, rather than the inherent inductive biases of convolutions. In this work, we reexamine the design spaces and test the limits of what a pure ConvNet can achieve.

Analysis of participants’ choices revealed that attention biased both value computation during choice and value update during learning. Value signals in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and prediction errors in the striatum were similarly biased by attention. In turn, participants’ focus of attention was dynamically modulated by ongoing learning. Attentional switches across dimensions correlated with activity in a frontoparietal attention network, which showed enhanced connectivity with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex between switches.

Researchers in both neuroscience and engineering are pursuing a better understanding of the internal representations and operations that undergird the successes and failures of DNNs. Neuroscientists additionally evaluate DNNs as models of brain computation by comparing their internal representations to those found in brains. It is therefore essential to have a method to easily and exhaustively extract and characterize the results of the internal operations of any DNN. Many models are implemented in PyTorch, the leading framework for building DNN models. Here we introduce TorchLens, a new open-source Python package for extracting and characterizing hidden-layer activations in PyTorch models. Uniquely among existing approaches to this problem, TorchLens has the following features: (1) it exhaustively extracts the results of all intermediate operations, not just those associated with PyTorch module objects, yielding a full record of every step in the model's computational graph, (2) it provides an intuitive visualization of the model's complete computational graph along with metadata about each computational step in a model's forward pass for further analysis, (3) it contains a built-in validation procedure to algorithmically verify the accuracy of all saved hidden-layer activations, and (4) the approach it uses can be automatically applied to any PyTorch model with no modifications, including models with conditional (if-then) logic in their forward pass, recurrent models, branching models where layer outputs are fed into multiple subsequent layers in parallel, and models with internally generated tensors (e.g., injections of noise). Furthermore, using TorchLens requires minimal additional code, making it easy to incorporate into existing pipelines for model development and analysis, and useful as a pedagogical aid when teaching deep learning concepts.

Some experts and scholars have conducted research on the decision-making management and predictive analysis methods of horse racing. Today, with the rapid development of information technology, the amount of data and data dimensions of horse racing competitions continue to explode. The increase in data scale and feature dimensions provides new challenges for competition management and competition prediction research. At present, traditional prediction algorithms can no longer meet the needs of horse racing situation prediction, but research has found that association rules and neural network algorithms provide a good solution to the classification and prediction problem. Based on the advantages of association rules and neural networks in analyzing data, according to the requirements of horse racing decision management, this paper adopts the B/S structure to realize the construction of the horse racing decision management optimization model from the three aspects of hierarchical structure, functional structure, and forecasting process. Combined with the horse racing decision management optimization model, based on a large number of experimental training data, the final conclusion is drawn: first, the factors that affect the horse racing performance are from large to small. The order of arrangement is: race schedule > age > gender > weight > rating > horse top three rate > jockey > weight load > harness > ranking > field nature > field > trainer; the second is the prediction and actual results of the neural network algorithm. The closest one, which is slightly higher than 90%, has the highest prediction accuracy; third, the average value of the horse racing performance prediction of this system during the review is only 2.01 s, and the misappraisal rate is 0.12%, indicating that the application value of this system is significant; fourth, in the average time spent in the two seasons, the average time spent in the second season was reduced compared with the average time spent in the first season, with a maximum reduction of 0.984 s, indicating a slight improvement in the performance of the 2020 season. Using this system to predict horse racing, results can improve the optimization of horse racing decision management to a certain extent.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Shuang"}],"citation-key":"2022zhang","container-title":"Scientific Programming","DOI":"10.1155/2022/4240244","ISSN":"1058-9244","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,11]]},"language":"en","page":"e4240244","source":"www.hindawi.com","title":"Optimal Model of Horse Racing Competition Decision Management Based on Association Rules and Neural Network","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/sp/2022/4240244/","volume":"2022"},{"id":"beekmans","author":[{"family":"Beekmans","given":"Created Gerard"},{"family":"Editor","given":"Managing"},{"family":"Dubbs","given":"Bruce"}],"citation-key":"beekmans","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Linux From Scratch - Version 12.0","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"2007spelke","abstract":"Human cognition is founded, in part, on four systems for representing objects, actions, number, and space.

Two aspects of human planning stand out—its efficiency and flexibility. Efficiency is especially impressive because plans must often be made in complex environments, and yet people successfully plan solutions to many everyday problems despite having limited cognitive resources1–3. Standard accounts in psychology, economics and artificial intelligence have suggested that human planning succeeds because people have a complete representation of a task and then use heuristics to plan future actions in that representation4–11. However, this approach generally assumes that task representations are fixed. Here we propose that task representations can be controlled and that such control provides opportunities to quickly simplify problems and more easily reason about them. We propose a computational account of this simplification process and, in a series of preregistered behavioural experiments, show that it is subject to online cognitive control12–14 and that people optimally balance the complexity of a task representation and its utility for planning and acting. These results demonstrate how strategically perceiving and conceiving problems facilitates the effective use of limited cognitive resources.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Ho","given":"Mark K."},{"family":"Abel","given":"David"},{"family":"Correa","given":"Carlos G."},{"family":"Littman","given":"Michael L."},{"family":"Cohen","given":"Jonathan D."},{"family":"Griffiths","given":"Thomas L."}],"citation-key":"2022ho","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-022-04743-9","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7912","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",6]]},"language":"en","license":"2022 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","number":"7912","page":"129-136","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"People construct simplified mental representations to plan","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04743-9","volume":"606"},{"id":"2023vanopheusden","abstract":"A hallmark of human intelligence is the ability to plan multiple steps into the future1,2.

Conversely, common planning tasks in cognitive science often have a lower complexity9,10 and impose a ceiling for the depth to which any player can plan. Here we investigate expertise in a complex board game that offers ample opportunity for skilled players to plan deeply. We use model fitting methods to show that human behaviour can be captured using a computational cognitive model based on heuristic search. To validate this model, we predict human choices, response times and eye movements. We also perform a Turing test and a reconstruction experiment. Using the model, we find robust evidence for increased planning depth with expertise in both laboratory and large-scale mobile data. Experts memorize and reconstruct board features more accurately.

This Primer describes the stages involved in Bayesian analysis, from specifying the prior and data models to deriving inference, model checking and refinement. We discuss the importance of prior and posterior predictive checking, selecting a proper technique for sampling from a posterior distribution, variational inference and variable selection. Examples of successful applications of Bayesian analysis across various research fields are provided, including in social sciences, ecology, genetics, medicine and more. We propose strategies for reproducibility and reporting standards, outlining an updated WAMBS (when to Worry and how to Avoid the Misuse of Bayesian Statistics) checklist. Finally, we outline the impact of Bayesian analysis on artificial intelligence, a major goal in the next decade.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Schoot","given":"Rens","non-dropping-particle":"van de"},{"family":"Depaoli","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"King","given":"Ruth"},{"family":"Kramer","given":"Bianca"},{"family":"Märtens","given":"Kaspar"},{"family":"Tadesse","given":"Mahlet G."},{"family":"Vannucci","given":"Marina"},{"family":"Gelman","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Veen","given":"Duco"},{"family":"Willemsen","given":"Joukje"},{"family":"Yau","given":"Christopher"}],"citation-key":"2021vandeschoot","container-title":"Nature Reviews Methods Primers","container-title-short":"Nat Rev Methods Primers","DOI":"10.1038/s43586-020-00001-2","ISSN":"2662-8449","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,14]]},"language":"en","license":"2021 Springer Nature Limited","number":"1","page":"1-26","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Bayesian statistics and modelling","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43586-020-00001-2","volume":"1"},{"id":"2023holmes","abstract":"In this paper, we present a new methodology for forecasting the results of mixed martial arts contests.

Here we show that, under a cognitively-plausible belief formation mechanism combining deductive and abductive reasoning, belief in mathematical arguments can undergo what we call an epistemic phase transition: a dramatic and rapidly-propagating jump from uncertainty to near-complete confidence at reasonable levels of claim-to-claim error rates. To show this, we analyze an unusual dataset of forty-eight machine-aided proofs from the formalized reasoning system Coq, including major theorems ranging from ancient to 21st Century mathematics, along with five hand-constructed cases including Euclid, Apollonius, Hernstein's Topics in Algebra, and Andrew Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.

It is, in fact, the network organization (more than the parts) that largely conditions most higher-level properties, which are not reducible to the properties of the individual parts. Can the topological organization of these webs provide some insight into their evolutionary origins? Both biological and artificial networks share some common architectural traits. They are often heterogeneous and sparse, and most exhibit different types of correlations, such as nestedness, modularity or hierarchical patterns. These properties have often been attributed to the selection of functionally meaningful traits. However, a proper formulation of generative network models suggests a rather different picture. Against the standard selection–optimization argument, some networks reveal the inevitable generation of complex patterns resulting from reuse and can be modelled using duplication–rewiring rules lacking functionality. These give rise to the observed heterogeneous, scale-free and modular architectures. Here, we examine the evidence for tinkering in cellular, technological and ecological webs and its impact in shaping their architecture. Our analysis suggests a serious consideration of the role played by selection as the origin of network topology. Instead, we suggest that the amplification processes associated with reuse might shape these graphs at the topological level. In biological systems, selection forces would take advantage of emergent patterns.\n            This article is part of the theme issue ‘Unifying the essential concepts of biological networks: biological insights and philosophical foundations’.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Solé","given":"Ricard"},{"family":"Valverde","given":"Sergi"}],"citation-key":"2020sole","container-title":"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","container-title-short":"Phil.

The results provide some new perspectives on the traditional philosophical questions of the nature of proof and of what grounds mathematical knowledge.","container-title":"Synthese","DOI":"10.1007/s11229-018-1778-8","ISSN":"1573-0964","issue":"1","journalAbbreviation":"Synthese","language":"en","page":"233-247","source":"Springer Link","title":"Acceptable gaps in mathematical proofs","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11229-018-1778-8","volume":"197","author":[{"family":"Andersen","given":"Line Edslev"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,18]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",1,1]]},"citation-key":"2020andersen","library":"polymath","citekey":"2020andersen"},{"id":"2023sharma","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              Scientists have grappled with reconciling biological evolution\n              1,2\n              with the immutable laws of the Universe defined by physics.

This allows objects to show evidence of selection, within well-defined boundaries of individuals or selected units. We introduce a measure called assembly (\n              A\n              ), capturing the degree of causation required to produce a given ensemble of objects. This approach enables us to incorporate novelty generation and selection into the physics of complex objects. It explains how these objects can be characterized through a forward dynamical process considering their assembly. By reimagining the concept of matter within assembly spaces, AT provides a powerful interface between physics and biology. It discloses a new aspect of physics emerging at the chemical scale, whereby history and causal contingency influence what exists.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Sharma","given":"Abhishek"},{"family":"Czégel","given":"Dániel"},{"family":"Lachmann","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Kempes","given":"Christopher P."},{"family":"Walker","given":"Sara I."},{"family":"Cronin","given":"Leroy"}],"citation-key":"2023sharma","container-title":"Nature","container-title-short":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-023-06600-9","ISSN":"0028-0836, 1476-4687","issue":"7982","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,12]]},"language":"en","page":"321-328","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Assembly theory explains and quantifies selection and evolution","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06600-9","volume":"622"},{"id":"2012blei","abstract":"Surveying a suite of algorithms that offer a solution to managing large document archives.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Blei","given":"David M."}],"citation-key":"2012blei","container-title":"Communications of the ACM","container-title-short":"Commun.

We discover clear sentiment, topic and persona-based patterns that both model the expected narrative event sequences of birth stories and highlight diverging pathways and exceptions to narrative norms. The authors' motivation to publicly post these personal stories can be a way to regain power after a surveilled and disempowering experience, and we explore power relationships between the personas in the stories, showing that these dynamics can vary with the type of birth (e.g., medicated vs unmedicated). Finally, birth stories exist in a space that is both public and deeply personal.

We then establish a mapping between our geometric framework and statistical mechanics of complex networks. This mapping interprets edges in a network as non-interacting fermions whose energies are hyperbolic distances between nodes, while the auxiliary fields coupled to edges are linear functions of these energies or distances. The geometric network ensemble subsumes the standard configuration model and classical random graphs as two limiting cases with degenerate geometric structures. Finally, we show that targeted transport processes without global topology knowledge, made possible by our geometric framework, are maximally efficient, according to all efficiency measures, in networks with strongest heterogeneity and clustering, and that this efficiency is remarkably robust with respect to even catastrophic disturbances and damages to the network structure.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Krioukov","given":"Dmitri"},{"family":"Papadopoulos","given":"Fragkiskos"},{"family":"Kitsak","given":"Maksim"},{"family":"Vahdat","given":"Amin"},{"family":"Boguna","given":"Marian"}],"citation-key":"2010krioukov","container-title":"Physical Review E","container-title-short":"Phys.

With the tree-likeness property of hyperbolic space, the underlying semantic hierarchy among words and topics can be better exploited to mine more interpretable topics. Furthermore, due to the superiority of hyperbolic geometry in representing hierarchical data, tree-structure knowledge can also be naturally injected to guide the learning of a topic hierarchy.

Ideally, we could incorporate our prior knowledge of this hierarchical structure into unsupervised learning algorithms that work on text data. Recent work by Nickel and Kiela (2017) proposed using hyperbolic instead of Euclidean embedding spaces to represent hierarchical data and demonstrated encouraging results when embedding graphs. In this work, we extend their method with a re-parameterization technique that allows us to learn hyperbolic embeddings of arbitrarily parameterized objects. We apply this framework to learn word and sentence embeddings in hyperbolic space in an unsupervised manner from text corpora. The resulting embeddings seem to encode certain intuitive notions of hierarchy, such as word-context frequency and phrase constituency. However, the implicit continuous hierarchy in the learned hyperbolic space makes interrogating the model's learned hierarchies more difficult than for models that learn explicit edges between items. The learned hyperbolic embeddings show improvements over Euclidean embeddings in some – but not all – downstream tasks, suggesting that hierarchical organization is more useful for some tasks than others.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Dhingra","given":"Bhuwan"},{"family":"Shallue","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Norouzi","given":"Mohammad"},{"family":"Dai","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Dahl","given":"George"}],"citation-key":"2018dhingra","container-title":"Proceedings of the Twelfth Workshop on Graph-Based Methods for Natural Language Processing (TextGraphs-12)","DOI":"10.18653/v1/W18-1708","editor":[{"family":"Glavaš","given":"Goran"},{"family":"Somasundaran","given":"Swapna"},{"family":"Riedl","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Hovy","given":"Eduard"}],"event-place":"New Orleans, Louisiana, USA","event-title":"TextGraphs 2018","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",6]]},"page":"59–69","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","publisher-place":"New Orleans, Louisiana, USA","source":"ACLWeb","title":"Embedding Text in Hyperbolic Spaces","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://aclanthology.org/W18-1708"},{"id":"gowers","abstract":"This paper considers the reasons mathematicians give for making probabilistic judgments about unproved mathematical statements, and discusses how one might interpret and justify such judgments more formally.

In this paper, we report on a series of 256 Web-based experiments in which groups of 16 individuals collectively solved a complex problem and shared information through different communication networks. As expected, we found that collective exploration improved average success over independent exploration because good solutions could diffuse through the network. In contrast to prior work, however, we found that efficient networks outperformed inefficient networks, even in a problem space with qualitative properties thought to favor inefficient networks. We explain this result in terms of individual-level explore-exploit decisions, which we find were influenced by the network structure as well as by strategic considerations and the relative payoff between maxima.

It was also a crucial decade in the dramatic, intersecting lives of some of history's greatest philosophers. In particular, four women whose parallel ideas would come to dominate the twentieth century-at once in necessary dialogue and striking contrast with one another. Simone de Beauvoir, already in a deep emotional and intellectual partnership with Jean-Paul Sartre, was laying the foundations for nothing less than the future of feminism. Born Alissa Rosenbaum in St. Petersburg before emigrating to the US in 1926, Ayn Rand was honing one of the most politically influential voices of the 20th century. Her novels The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged would reach the hearts and minds millions of Americans in the decades to come, becoming canonical libertarian texts, which continue to echo today among Silicon Valley's tech elite. Hannah Arendt was developing some of today's most important leftwing ideas, culminating with the publication of The Origins of Totalitarianism and her arrival as a peerless intellectual celebrity. Perhaps the greatest thinker of all was a classmate of de Beauvoir: Simone Weil, who turned away from fame to devote herself entirely to refugee aid and the resistance movement during the war. Ultimately, in 1943, she would starve to death in England, a martyr and true saint in the eyes of many. Few authors can synthesize gripping storytelling with sophisticated philosophy like Wolfram Eilenberger.

Participants consistently chose compositional (over non-compositional) extrapolations and interpolations of functions. Experiments designed to elicit priors over functional patterns revealed an inductive bias for compositional structure. Compositional functions were perceived as subjectively more predictable than non-compositional functions, and exhibited other signatures of predictability, such as enhanced memorability and reduced numerosity.

While all students agree as to the facts reported, they disagree on theory and explanation. 5 kinds of experiments (latent learning, vicarious trial and error, searching for the stimulus, hypotheses, and spatial orientation) are described and discussed. The conditions which favor (cognitive) narrow strip-maps and which favor broad comprehensive maps in rats and in men are considered. Narrow strip-maps seem to be indicated by (1) a damaged brain, (2) an inadequate arrangement of environmentally presented cues, (3) a surplus of repetitions on the original trained-on path, and (4) the presence of too strongly frustrating conditions. The fourth point is elaborated. It is contended that some of the psychological mechanisms which clinical psychologists and other students of personality have uncovered as factors underlying many individual and social maladjustments can be interpreted \"as narrowings of our cognitive maps due to too strong motivations or to too intense frustrations.\" (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)","container-title":"Psychological Review","DOI":"10.1037/h0061626","ISSN":"1939-1471","issue":"4","note":"publisher-place: US\npublisher: American Psychological Association","page":"189-208","source":"APA PsycNet","title":"Cognitive maps in rats and men","volume":"55","author":[{"family":"Tolman","given":"Edward C."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1948"]]},"citation-key":"1948tolman","library":"My Library","citekey":"1948tolman"},{"id":"2017dennett","type":"book","call-number":"BF38 .D46 2017","edition":"Fortieth Anniversary Edition","event-place":"Cambridge, Massachusetts","ISBN":"978-0-262-53438-3","number-of-pages":"393","publisher":"A Bradford Book, MIT Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge, Massachusetts","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Brainstorms: philosophical essays on mind and psychology","title-short":"Brainstorms","author":[{"family":"Dennett","given":"D.

In this volume his finest writings on modern society make their long-awaited appearance in English. This book is a celebration of the masses--their tastes, amusements, and everyday lives. Taking up themes of modernity, such as isolation and alienation, urban culture, and the relation between the group and the individual, Kracauer explores a kaleidoscope of topics: shopping arcades, the cinema, bestsellers and their readers, photography, dance, hotel lobbies, Kafka, the Bible, and boredom. For Kracauer, the most revelatory facets of modern life in the West lie on the surface, in the ephemeral and the marginal. Of special fascination to him is the United States, where he eventually settled after fleeing Germany and whose culture he sees as defined almost exclusively by \"the ostentatious display of surface.\"With these essays, written in the 1920s and early 1930s and edited by the author in 1963, Kracauer was the first to demonstrate that studying the everyday world of the masses can bring great rewards. The Mass Ornament today remains a refreshing tribute to popular culture, and its impressively interdisciplinary essays continue to shed light not only on Kracauer's later work but also on the ideas of the Frankfurt School, the genealogy of film theory and cultural studies, Weimar cultural politics, and, not least, the exigencies of intellectual exile.In his introduction, Thomas Levin situates Kracauer in a turbulent age, illuminates the forces that influenced him--including his friendships with Walter Benjamin, Theodor Adorno, and other Weimar intellectuals--and provides the context necessary for understanding his ideas. Until now, Kracauer has been known primarily for his writings on the cinema. This volume brings us the full scope of his gifts as one of the most wide-ranging and penetrating interpreters of modern life.","ISBN":"978-0-674-55163-3","language":"en","note":"Google-Books-ID: yIWJASvV9uwC","number-of-pages":"420","publisher":"Harvard University Press","source":"Google Books","title":"The Mass Ornament: Weimar Essays","title-short":"The Mass Ornament","author":[{"family":"Kracauer","given":"Siegfried"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1995"]]},"citation-key":"1995kracauer","library":"My Library","citekey":"1995kracauer"},{"id":"1972horkheimer","type":"book","abstract":"These essays, written in the 1930s and 1940s, represent a first selection in English from the major work of the founder of the famous Institute for Social Research in Frankfurt.

However, there is no consensus about the representational format(s) of biological cognition. This paper provides a survey of evidence from computational cognitive psychology, perceptual psychology, developmental psychology, comparative psychology, and social psychology, and concludes that one type of format that routinely crops up is the language-of-thought (LoT). We outline six core properties of LoTs: (i) discrete constituents; (ii) role-filler independence; (iii) predicate–argument structure; (iv) logical operators; (v) inferential promiscuity; and (vi) abstract content. These properties cluster together throughout cognitive science. Bayesian computational modeling, compositional features of object perception, complex infant and animal reasoning, and automatic, intuitive cognition in adults all implicate LoT-like structures. Instead of regarding LoT as a relic of the previous century, researchers in cognitive science and philosophy-of-mind must take seriously the explanatory breadth of LoT-based architectures. We grant that the mind may harbor many formats and architectures, including iconic and associative structures as well as deep-neural-network-like architectures. However, as computational/representational approaches to the mind continue to advance, classical compositional symbolic structures – that is, LoTs – only prove more flexible and well-supported over time.","container-title":"Behavioral and Brain Sciences","DOI":"10.1017/S0140525X22002849","ISSN":"0140-525X, 1469-1825","journalAbbreviation":"Behav Brain Sci","language":"en","page":"e261","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Best Game in Town: The Reemergence of the Language-of-Thought Hypothesis across the Cognitive Sciences","title-short":"The Best Game in Town","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0140525X22002849/type/journal_article","volume":"46","author":[{"family":"Quilty-Dunn","given":"Jake"},{"family":"Porot","given":"Nicolas"},{"family":"Mandelbaum","given":"Eric"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,10]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"citation-key":"2023quilty-dunn","library":"My Library","citekey":"2023quilty-dunn"},{"id":"2011chalmers","type":"article-journal","container-title":"Journal of Cognitive Science","DOI":"10.17791/JCS.2011.12.4.325","issue":"4","page":"325-359","source":"DOI.org (CSL JSON)","title":"A Computational Foundation for the Study of Cognition","URL":"https://doi.org/10.17791/JCS.2011.12.4.325","volume":"12","author":[{"family":"Chalmers","given":"David J."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,10]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",12]]},"citation-key":"2011chalmers","library":"My Library","citekey":"2011chalmers"},{"id":"1995egan","type":"article-journal","container-title":"The Philosophical Review","DOI":"10.2307/2185977","ISSN":"0031-8108","issue":"2","note":"publisher: [Duke University Press, Philosophical Review]","page":"181-203","source":"JSTOR","title":"Computation and Content","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2185977","volume":"104","author":[{"family":"Egan","given":"Frances"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,10]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["1995"]]},"citation-key":"1995egan","library":"My Library","citekey":"1995egan"},{"id":"1997gross","type":"chapter","abstract":"This chapter traces the origins of our current ideas about visual cortex. We begin, in Section 2, long before the beginning of science, in the 30th century BCE, with the earliest description of the cerebral cortex. In Section 3 we consider the views of Greek philosopher-scientists on the functions of the brain. Section 4 concerns the long period in which there were virtually no advances in Europe in understanding the brain. In Section 5 we describe how even after Western brain research was well underway again, the cerebral cortex tended to be ignored. Section 6 considers the beginning of the modern study of the cerebral cortex and the localization therein of psychological functions. Our focus narrows in Section 7 and we consider how a specifically visual area of the cortex was delineated. The final section brings us to the theme of the entire volume, the extrastriate visual cortices. This review ends in the early 1980s about the time of the award of the Nobel Prize to Hubel and Wiesel for their discoveries on the visual cortex.","container-title":"Extrastriate Cortex in Primates","event-place":"Boston, MA","ISBN":"978-1-4757-9625-4","language":"en","note":"DOI: 10.1007/978-1-4757-9625-4_1","page":"1-58","publisher":"Springer US","publisher-place":"Boston, MA","source":"Springer Link","title":"From Imhotep to Hubel and Wiesel","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4757-9625-4_1","author":[{"family":"Gross","given":"Charles G."}],"editor":[{"family":"Rockland","given":"Kathleen S."},{"family":"Kaas","given":"Jon H."},{"family":"Peters","given":"Alan"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,10]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["1997"]]},"citation-key":"1997gross","library":"My Library","citekey":"1997gross"},{"id":"1943mcculloch","type":"article-journal","abstract":"Because of the “all-or-none” character of nervous activity, neural events and the relations among them can be treated by means of propositional logic. It is found that the behavior of every net can be described in these terms, with the addition of more complicated logical means for nets containing circles; and that for any logical expression satisfying certain conditions, one can find a net behaving in the fashion it describes. It is shown that many particular choices among possible neurophysiological assumptions are equivalent, in the sense that for every net behaving under one assumption, there exists another net which behaves under the other and gives the same results, although perhaps not in the same time. Various applications of the calculus are discussed.","container-title":"The bulletin of mathematical biophysics","DOI":"10.1007/BF02478259","ISSN":"1522-9602","issue":"4","journalAbbreviation":"Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics","language":"en","page":"115-133","source":"Springer Link","title":"A logical calculus of the ideas immanent in nervous activity","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02478259","volume":"5","author":[{"family":"McCulloch","given":"Warren S."},{"family":"Pitts","given":"Walter"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,10]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["1943",12,1]]},"citation-key":"1943mcculloch","library":"My Library","citekey":"1943mcculloch"},{"id":"zotero-3396","type":"webpage","title":"What the Frog's Eye Tells the Frog's Brain | IEEE Journals & Magazine | IEEE Xplore","URL":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4065609","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,10]]},"citation-key":"zotero-3396","library":"My Library","citekey":"zotero-3396"},{"id":"2005bullock","type":"article-journal","abstract":"In their Perspective, [ Bullock et al. ][1] discuss recent evidence suggesting that the Neuron Doctrine, conceived nearly a century ago, cannot encompass important aspects of information processing in the brain.

Some researchers address this by constraining the hypothesis space through assumptions about what the human mind can and cannot do, while others constrain it through principles of rationality and adaptation. Recent work in economics, psychology, neuroscience, and linguistics has begun to integrate both approaches by augmenting rational models with cognitive constraints, incorporating rational principles into cognitive architectures, and applying optimality principles to understanding neural representations. We identify the rational use of limited resources as a unifying principle underlying these diverse approaches, expressing it in a new cognitive modeling paradigm called resource-rational analysis. The integration of rational principles with realistic cognitive constraints makes resource-rational analysis a promising framework for reverse-engineering cognitive mechanisms and representations. It has already shed new light on the debate about human rationality and can be leveraged to revisit classic questions of cognitive psychology within a principled computational framework. We demonstrate that resource-rational models can reconcile the mind's most impressive cognitive skills with people's ostensive irrationality. Resource-rational analysis also provides a new way to connect psychological theory more deeply with artificial intelligence, economics, neuroscience, and linguistics.","container-title":"Behavioral and Brain Sciences","DOI":"10.1017/S0140525X1900061X","ISSN":"0140-525X, 1469-1825","language":"en","page":"e1","source":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Resource-rational analysis: Understanding human cognition as the optimal use of limited computational resources","title-short":"Resource-rational analysis","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/resourcerational-analysis-understanding-human-cognition-as-the-optimal-use-of-limited-computational-resources/586866D9AD1D1EA7A1EECE217D392F4A","volume":"43","author":[{"family":"Lieder","given":"Falk"},{"family":"Griffiths","given":"Thomas L."}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",9,10]]},"issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",1]]},"citation-key":"2020lieder","library":"My Library","citekey":"2020lieder"},{"id":"1988mcclelland","type":"book","abstract":"multiple simultaneous constraints  parallel distributed processing [PDP] / examples of PDP models  representation and learning in PDP models  origins of parallel distributed processing (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)","collection-title":"Readings in cognitive science:  A perspective from psychology and artificial intelligence","event-place":"San Mateo, CA, US","ISBN":"978-1-55860-013-3","note":"page: 72","number-of-pages":"52","publisher":"Morgan Kaufmann","publisher-place":"San Mateo, CA, US","source":"APA PsycNet","title":"The Appeal of Parallel Distributed Processing","title-short":"The Appeal of Parallel Distributed Processing","author":[{"family":"McClelland","given":"James L."},{"family":"Rumelhart","given":"David E."},{"family":"Hinton","given":"G.
