>**Teleology** refers to a goal-oriented explanation, interpreting structures or dynamics in terms of their functions. In biological contexts, teleology is a consequence of natural selection, and in cultural contexts a result of learning and planning. Typically teleology implies internal states supporting **conditional branching**â€”pursuing different behaviors as a result of contingent history and context.
