# Highlights
- we have studied these phenomena in separate boxes to which we have given special names—politics, economics, the social structure, culture—without seeing that these boxes are constructs more of our imagination than of reality. The phenomena dealt with in these separate boxes are so closely intermeshed that each presumes the other, each affects the other, each is incomprehensible without taking into account the other boxes ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmc8k2dn16wtqwn017dwjtg3))
    - Note: Key argument: distinction bad.
- three important turning points of our modern world-system ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmc8j01ymyjwxmmfd1g7xsvp))
    - Note: Interesting selection! What is the motivation?
- the separate boxes of analysis—what in the universities are called the disciplines—are an obstacle, not an aid, to understanding the world ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmc8mx90xmb0w9g0npyx578z))
- social reality within which we live and which determines what our options are has not been the multiple national states of which we are citizens but something larger, which we call a world-system ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmc8nfbfztkb59vk81zw338z))
- WORLD-SYSTEMS ANALYSIS originated in the early 1970s as a new perspective on social reality ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmc8s4ytarmkrnzpgrt4djjr))
- The imperative of the endless accumulation of capital had generated a need for constant technological change, a constant expansion of frontiers—geographical, psychological, intellectual, scientific. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmc8tnen4zrarpq5pxpryreg))
- Still, we must remember that at least until the late eighteenth century, there was no sharp distinction between science and philosophy in the ways in which knowledge was defined ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmc8wsnem9mc5yykspe3e1qm))
- Knowledge was still considered a unitary field. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmc8wxfc9rp4238rra7n8jqy))
- The emphasis of the sciences was on empirical (even experimental) research and hypothesis testing. The emphasis of the humanities was on empathetic insight, what later was called hermeneutic understanding ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmc8ye8zdpavn9amny795c8q))
    - Note: Philosophy as the queen of the sciences vs. handmaiden, still such an evocative phrase to me!
- The French Revolution propagated two quite revolutionary ideas. One was that political change was not exceptional or bizarre but normal and thus constant. The second was that “sovereignty”—the right of the state to make autonomous decisions within its realm—did not reside in (belong to) either a monarch or a legislature but in the “people” who, alone, could legitimate a regime. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmc97h270srv2k6avxszcwzv))
- If political change was now to be considered normal and sovereignty was to reside in the people, it suddenly became imperative for everyone to understand what it was that explained the nature and pace of change, and how the “people” arrived at, could arrive at, the decisions they were said to be making. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmc98cjdhq6054rmqfmshh4v))
- They argued that human social life was quite unlike the physical phenomena studied by the pure scientists, because of the factor of human will, and this emphasis on what we today call human agency led them to think of themselves as “humanists” rather than “scientists.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmc9bngwt16vfj88sq57s24p))
    - Note: Difference between natural and social sciences
- the dominant liberal ideology of the nineteenth century insisted that *modernity* was defined by the differentiation of three social spheres: the market, the state, and the civil society. The three spheres operated, it was asserted, according to different logics, and it was good to keep them separated from each other—in social life and therefore in intellectual life ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmc9efxe455canvar04nvmmc))
- So we call these three disciplines nomothetic disciplines (that is, disciplines in search of scientific laws) as opposed to the idiographic discipline which history aspired to be—that is, a discipline that is predicated on the uniqueness of social phenomena. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmc9fe5pw32a5xwd041b5hmv))
- One of the essential conditions for studying these peoples was that they fell under the political jurisdiction of a modern state, which guaranteed order and the safe access of the anthropologist ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmc9hrganq298xpk5f5zynfz))
- Ethnographers served in many ways as the primary interpreters of their peoples to the modern outsiders who governed them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmc9jfyd9nct2wp8fnxh01z9))
- The persistent question that was in the back of their minds was how to explain that these “high civilizations” were not “modern” like the pan-European world. The answer the Orientalists seemed to put forth was that there was something in the composite culture of these civilizations which had “frozen” their history, and had made it impossible for them to move forward, as had the Western Christian world, to “modernity ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmc9kz5ane8n3ny8zx5e80wd))
- In 1945, however, the world changed in very important ways, and as a result this configuration of the social science disciplines came under significant challenge. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmc9ra62smwg1qpctbskatxt))
- Development, as the term came to be used after 1945, was based on a familiar explanatory mechanism, a theory of stages. Those who used this concept were assuming that the separate units—"national societies"—all developed in the same fundamental way (thus satisfying the nomothetic demand) but at distinct paces (thus acknowledging how different the states seemed to be at the present time). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmc9q84aymc8d5kt6cw7sqsj))
- In the social sciences, four debates in the period 1945-70 set the scene for the emergence of world-systems analysis ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmc9tqpczxf4h1vm2v1hdp1k))
    - Note: Make note! Mentioned in Polisci class?
- Like Khrushchev’s speech, the debate about the Asiatic mode of production led to doubts, and cracked the rigid conceptual inheritances of so-called orthodox Marxism ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmc9zy6302rn5k9z1x6bhjt4))
- Thirdly, the debate was essentially about the unit of analysis, although this language was never used ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmca3j9413214yhqepjzy9nr))
- Braudel put forward a language about social times that came to inflect further work. He criticized “event-dominated” or episodic history (*histoire événementielle*), by which he meant traditional idiographic, empiricist, political historiography, as “dust. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmca5rmke6q9gn0ms2gv9gp0))
- It was dust in a double sense: that it spoke about ephemeral phenomena; and that it got into our eyes, preventing us from seeing the real underlying structures ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmca5xg4bew8383ss3ev1v27))
- he insisted on two other social times that the two cultures had neglected: structural time (or long-lasting, but not eternal, basic structures that underlay historical systems), and the cyclical processes within the structures (or medium-run trends, such as the expansions and contractions of the world-economy) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmca6xn0mg7bkgagmeytmgqb))
- The world revolution of 1968 of course primarily concerned a series of major political issues ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmca7q4jba2asev5bp54p6zd))
    - Note: Another list of contexts to ref.
- World-systems analysis was an attempt to combine coherently concern with the unit of analysis, concern with social temporalities, and concern with the barriers that had been erected between different social science disciplines. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmca8t1ky9ws6zzhcrphe9gb))
- Putting in the hyphen was intended to underline that we are talking not about systems, economies, empires *of the* (whole) world, but about systems, economies, empires *that are* a world ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmcaa07jwbcw2gssswvyx6h1))
- in “world-systems” we are dealing with a spatial/temporal zone which cuts across many political and cultural units, one that represents an integrated zone of activity and institutions which obey certain systemic rules ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmcaah21fkjak6qvrf5sr6c8))
- The categories of types of historical systems—minisystems, world-empires, and world-economies— seemed to be another way of expressing Polanyi’s three forms of economic organization. Mini-systems utilized reciprocity, world-empires redistribution, and world-economies market exchanges. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmcac1d2nad3hxfgxr4rg5eq))
- it was the production processes and not the states that were core-like and peripheral. In world-systems analysis, core-periphery is a *relational* concept, not a pair of terms that are reified, that is, have separate essential meanings ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmcacvc8fdhwjp89g85pfjac))
- Braudel would insist on a sharp distinction between the sphere of the free market and the sphere of monopolies. He called only the latter capitalism and, far from being the same thing as the free market, he said that capitalism was the “anti-market. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmcaeg35axsqjq1n37cs1y1s))
## New highlights added January 28, 2024 at 1:07 AM
- world-systems rather than states as units of analysis, insistence on the *longue durée*, and a unidisciplinary approach ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn3hwxpdd35y5e10xwe3ppzj))
## New highlights added January 30, 2024 at 11:57 PM
- social science had to be historical, looking at phenomena over long periods as well as over large spaces. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn9twbtjb8nyctsaazxg95d1))
- World-systems analysts insist that rather than reduce complex situations to simpler variables, the effort should be to complexify and contextualize all so-called simpler variables in order to understand real social situations ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn9w06km1pn6k0h8j5433s48))
- World-systems analysts have insisted that wage-labor is only one of the many forms of labor control within a capitalist system, and not at all the most profitable one from the point of view of capital. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn9w2wbv855sf7s4spfddb32))
- states in the capitalist world-economy do not have the autonomy or isolation which makes it possible to label them as having a particular mode of production. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn9w2zrmnw67r84gjfexeehc))
