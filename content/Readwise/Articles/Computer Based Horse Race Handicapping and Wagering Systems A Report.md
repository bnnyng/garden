- . In order for a fundamental statistical model to be able to compete effectively, it must rival the public in sophistication and comprehensiveness. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbsndns0kn528df68r3xa502))
- The author's guiding principle in factor improvement has been a combination of educated guessing and trial and error. Fortunately, the historical data makes the final decision as to which particular definition is superior. The best is the one that produces the greatest increase in predictive accuracy when included in the model. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbsnh8qfbeffss836athg264))
- What it does suggest, is that careful and conservative statistical tests and methods should be used on as large a data sample as possible. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbspmkjbazbbamdxnybp95f2))
- e. An extremely important step in model development, and one that the author believes has been generally overlooked in the literature, is the estimation of the relation of the model's probability estimates to the public's estimates, and the adjustment of the model's estimates to incorporate whatever information can be gleaned from the public's estimatcs.

- . It is necessary to correct for this bias in order to accurately estimate the advantage of any particular bet.' In a sense, what is needed is a way to combine the judgements of two experts, (i.e. the fundamental model and the public). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbsprcx6dn5yf1y7ex3xbsk4))
- A heuristic measure of the potential profitability of a handicapping model, borne out in practice, is the amount by which its inclusion in the combined model of equation (1) along with the public probability estimate causes the ff to increase over the value achieved by the public estimate alone: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbsptmh5cms817ga8gn7cht3))
