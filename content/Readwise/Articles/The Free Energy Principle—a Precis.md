# Highlights
- The FEP allows us to specify mathematically the time evolution of a coupled random dynamical system, in a way that links the evolution of the system and that of its “beliefs” over time (or belief updating: changing your mind in light of new evidence or information).

    - Note: Come back to this paragraph, try and parse
- sparse coupling, that is, the idea that “things” can be defined in terms of the absence of direct influence between subsets of a system (that can be partitioned into things or particles ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk9nfsjfyp1sac33wz1ztb5v))
- Loosely speaking, the FEP says that observable things do on average what it is characteristic or typical for them to do, given what they are—and that in doing so, they end up attuning to (and indeed tuning) the statistics of the things to which they are coupled ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk9nkzpmam93f5bdj3hypcxx))
- mechanical theories allow us to generate dynamics, whereas principles can be used to write down mechanical theories ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk9nnsghsjx4pydpwq1e9hvy))
- Importantly, the FEP is not an empirical theory that could be subjected to verification or falsification. Rather, much like the principle of least action or the principle of maximum entropy in physics, the FEP is used to write down theories that can, in turn, be subjected to empirical verification procedures ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk9nqvdgn9wq8rrmparct7bv))
    - Note: Come back to this too...don't understand.
- In other words, the rock exists as a rock (i.e., as the thing that it is) because it is disconnected from the rest of the system in a specific way. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk9qenzbqeq256q9rhv744er))
- system” to refer to the whole random dynamical system, and the word “thing” or “particle” to refer to Markov blanketed subsets of that system.) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk9qffrgmmx85erw0xnz3fc4))
- The blanket is defined as the set of states conditioned upon which states internal to a particle are rendered independent of states external to the particle ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk9qhtxeheewwy9sc4t3e2vj))
- FEP says that if a system contains a Markov blanket, then states internal to the boundary will look as if they encode a kind of belief about what lies beyond the boundary, i.e., a Bayesian belief or conditional probability distribution, parameterised by internal states ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk9qj7b1cwp3csztrxpk7ee7))
- one can use Bayesian mechanics to model, design, and build things that evince “sentient” behavior (e.g., cells and minds)—where “sentient” means “responsive to sensory stimuli” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk9qmr47mev1qykfw72a43tn))
- The FEP inverts this style of explanation: it does not say that organisms must minimize free energy or surprise to exist. Rather, the FEP says that if things exist, then they minimize free energy or surprise—or can be modeled as such ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk9qp1b29hzd2qq4jw3mdt0g))
- Under the FEP, the novel capabilities of the whole are underwritten by the fact that the whole is less than the sum of its parts. Indeed, a whole can only function as an integrated whole if we remove degrees of freedom from its parts. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk9qqgk0xtadhrsaejxybct7))
- Similarly, the FEP stands in contrast to approaches that would split the sphere of mind or life from the sphere of physical phenomena, such as some versions of the enactive approach (e.g., [[34]).](https://www.dialecticalsystems.eu/contributions/the-free-energy-principle-a-precis/#_bookmark39) The FEP eschews all such distinctions and embraces a physics of thingness that ranges from subatomic particles to galaxy clusters—and every kind of thing in between ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk9qv4sdfccavcenrecqacpd))
- Importantly, the resulting philosophical perspective is not physicalist reductionism (a reduction of causal efficacy to “mere” physics)—but rather, a deep commitment to anti-reductionism, emphasizing the causal contributions of things at every scale to the overall dynamics of the nested system ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk9qtt8eh7jy6gqxb9ej4fg6))
