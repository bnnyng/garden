# Highlights
- So looking at the logistic sigmoid function now in the context of the logistic regression model, what happens here in the logistic regression model is that we pass the net inputs to the logistic activation function, and then we have this threshold unit which checks whether the logistic activation function is greater than 0.5 or not.
  And if it is greater than 0.5, it'll return class label one. Otherwise, if it's equal or smaller than 0.5, it'll return class label zero. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6vk1144zra18yq7st58fjav))
- The perceptron algorithm will only converge if we have a linearly separable data set. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6vk2hqcjjem2ns5f109vx5d))
- The logistic regression classifier will always converge. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6vk3xrw0ajs2nzz9yxg7vx0))
