    - Note: Human behavior is determined by surroundings and not inherent characteristics.
- In a dérive one or more persons during a certain period drop their relations, their work and leisure activities, and all their other usual motives for movement and action, and let themselves be drawn by the attractions of the terrain and the encounters they find there.

    - Note: Basic description of the act.
- But the action of chance is naturally conservative and in a new setting tends to reduce everything to habit or to an alternation between a limited number of variants. Progress means breaking through fields where chance holds sway by creating new conditions more favorable to our purposes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hysv8fzzxvy8srktc6t04xf0))
- the first psychogeographical attractions discovered by dérivers may tend to fixate them around new habitual axes, to which they will constantly be drawn back. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hysv8txnz4ymck7tjk9yxtjn))
    - Note: What?
- “Men can see nothing around them that is not their own image; everything speaks to them of themselves. Their very landscape is alive.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hysvd878nabbsjetnfczz53b))

- At its minimum it can be limited to a small self-contained ambience: a single neighborhood or even a single block of houses if it’s interesting enough (the extreme case being a static-dérive of an entire day within the Saint-Lazare train station).

    - Note: Kind of a cute idea, size of ambiance.
- possible rendezvous ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyswajffxv4yawx1w0a5azqr))
    - Note: Going alone to a specific location at a specific time.
- Beyond the discovery of unities of ambience, of their main components and their spatial localization, one comes to perceive their principal axes of passage, their exits and their defenses. One arrives at the central hypothesis of the existence of psychogeographical pivotal points. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hysweaeads0ajsdenyqgwjt2))
- “The *dérive* (with its flow of acts, its gestures, its strolls, its encounters) was *to the totality* exactly what psychoanalysis (in the best sense) is to language. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyswh0q4tr99efj8n69qx9c7))
- But just as analysis unaccompanied with anything else is almost always *contraindicated,* so continual dériving is dangerous to the extent that the individual, having gone too far (not without bases, but...) without defenses, is threatened with explosion, dissolution, dissociation, disintegration.
