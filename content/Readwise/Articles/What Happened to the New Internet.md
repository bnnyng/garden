# Highlights
- Instead of a singular thing, we can think of the New Internet as a series of trends and movements that at times found themselves aligned over the same basic sentiment – 'the internet is broken' – even if the means they chose to do something about this heavily diverged.

- We use the internet constantly everyday, but rarely without distress, be it conscious or subconscious. This is not to say it's not still capable of wonder, beauty, and bliss. It's just that these moments have become the exception before the norm. The internet *works* but not for us. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hfe86n3x6x4y2je4ck0txshc))
- Platform capitalism, surveillance capitalism, the attention economy, the stack, cybernetic theory, fully automated luxury communism – each of these phrases would have their moment in the sun, as would the provocateurs who would sling them around in tweets, essays, and downtown parties.

- DeFi claimed all the reformist zeal of the New Internet, but instead of setting its crosshairs on Facebook it aimed them at JP Morgan ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hfebjrshgnmch12q3f2q3421))
- This supported the hypothesis that 'governance' in the context of a cryptocurrency trading protocol was something of a [misnomer](https://otherinter.net/research/uniswap-governance-findings/). There wasn't actually a whole lot to govern, nor an engaged constituency of voters ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hfec3apdmbyxst3dr89s0ge2))
- messages that defended crypto as a bastion of the New Internet and financial freedom. In private conversations though, there was a frank embrace of the medium as nothing more than a game of wealth accumulation with underlying systems of governance that were intractably broken ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hfec3sze9796gr868w491ch4))
- Guiding the space' felt like a losing strategy. There might have been some domains where it could have worked, but to the extent that the space we were trying to influence was crypto, it felt like there were structural blockers to our effectiveness. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hfec7d4b4q5hkk9v5ne80nzn))
- By shape shifting between utopian global computer and Ponzi dispenser, crypto both indoctrinated New Internet practitioners and implicated them amongst a crowd of day traders that they otherwise would have been repulsed by.

- Whether earnest career ambitions, growing up, or simply greed, these forces all can cause value drift, a process that slowly corrodes even the most steadfast of moral convictions. The New Internet failed to provide a clear enough plot, a straightforward enough of a product, nor legible enough of a movement to fend off the effects of value drift ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hfec8sgyhxc1bbnd7eq2hrys))
- One of the most sinister ways that greed works is that it’s right there pulling the levers, and yet so deeply embodied that it doesn’t feel deserving of mention.
