# Highlights
- All women eventually recognise the importance placed upon their bodies. It is as though girls are walking through a forest unaware and are then shown the trees. They can wonder how the trees got there, how long they have been growing and how deep their roots really go. But there is little they can do about them and it is almost impossible to imagine the world any other way ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hc982x6ftnxewnmafdy53q1p))
- The problem with all of these explanations is that the correlation between income and weight at the population level in advanced countries is driven almost entirely by women. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hc983j32sjznw5344pb67w59))
- Myriad studies find that overweight or obese women are paid less than their thinner peers while there is little difference in wages between obese men and men in the medically defined “normal” range. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hc984rv702magsw032s0wwzz))
- The upper estimates of the wage premium for a woman being thin are so significant that she might find it almost as valuable to lose weight as she would to gain additional education. The wage premium for getting a master’s degree is around 18%, only 1.8 times the premium a fat women could, in theory, earn by losing around 65lbs—roughly the amount that a moderately obese women of average height would have to lose to be in the medically defined “normal” range ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hc985w7nj5dq72dr23w8zmgs))
- Perhaps women do feel bad about themselves because they compare themselves to the gazelles that populate the covers of magazines and are duped into thinking those photos are unedited and attainable. Maybe their parents or a doctor commented on their weight when they were young. But in addition to those pressures is the powerful incentive of the market: women accurately perceive that failing to lose weight or be thin will literally cost them.

- It is economically rational for everyone to devote time to education because it has clear returns in the labour market and for future wages. In the same way it appears to be economically rational for women to pursue being thin. Obsessing over what and how much to eat and paying for fancy exercise classes are investments that will bear returns. For men they are not.

- Even glossy women’s magazines now model scepticism toward top-down narratives about how we should look…but the psychological parasite of the ideal woman has evolved to survive in an ecosystem that pretends to resist her,” writes Jia Tolentino in her book “Trick Mirror”*.* Feminism “has not eradicated the tyranny of the ideal woman but, rather, has entrenched it and made it trickier.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hc988j7yc02mfxdr48e4vafe))
