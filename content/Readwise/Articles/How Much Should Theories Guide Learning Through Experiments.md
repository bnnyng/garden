# Highlights
- This approach could be called “strongly” theory-driven: they have tentative explanations of what drives behavior that strongly influence how they sample these spaces ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzn0c73ytx1g37fqx1whs0mm))
    - Note: That is, uses intuitions to decide what kind of data to collect.
- what is a tractable representation of the larger space from which I am sampling, and how can I instead randomly sample from that? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzn0brzfakb2cc91s7awwd4s))
- they might consider what the space of intervention formats with possible effects on those behaviors are, and draw a random sample from this space rather than designing an experiment around some format they have a hunch about.

- theories, i.e., lower dimensional explanations designed to most efficiently and representatively account for the ground truth space ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzn0h3tt8whp3g4gtg8avkx2))
- perceived epistemic success (how well does the theory account for only the data they collected) and “objective performance,” how well they account for representative samples from the full ground truth distribution. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzn0hfbmf0sq8r2bxqkptstz))
- The agents aiming to confirm, falsify theories, or resolve theoretical disagreements end up with an illusion of epistemic success: they develop promising accounts for the data they collected, while completely misrepresenting the ground truth that they intended to learn about. Agents experimenting in theory-motivated ways acquire less diverse or less representative samples from the ground truth that are also easier to account for.
