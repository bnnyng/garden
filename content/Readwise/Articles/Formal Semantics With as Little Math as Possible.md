# Highlights
- Formal semantics rests on the belief that by and large (there are some exceptions, e.g. idioms), if you know the meanings of a bunch of words, you can combine them together and understand the meaning of that sentence. To put it in our terms, semantics is **compositional.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqq5y62nw75e7yj5vmj8p29y))
- Verbs like “is” (called copulas) have no rights. We are allowed to ignore them, because all they do is pass up whatever’s below them. It’s like they’re not even there! Actually, what they are is the identity function x = x, so “is” is there, it’s just not doing anything worth commenting on.

- One way is to take all the individuals and see if the sentence “[this individual] is a cat” is true or false (this is the characteristic function of the set, in case anyone quizzes you about this later). If it’s true, that individual goes into our set of cats. If it’s false, we know it isn’t in the set “cats ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqq6d3estmbqw90npnekxb0p))
