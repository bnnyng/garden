# Highlights
- Just to summarize how the perceptron makes these predictions, we have inputs where we have a given number of input variables here, X one and X two, we have model parameters, W one, W two, and the bias unit.
  And we use those together to compute the weighted sum. Then we apply a threshold to this weighted sum to come up with a class label predictions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6s5vkckw34dgz7vrstj8bdb))
- Given a perceptron with a classification task, we have inputs or features or measurements, and the outputs represent our class labels. And the number of inputs depends on the number of dimensions in our data set.
  So in our two dimensional data set where we have two measurement variables or feature variables, we have two input nodes to this perceptron. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6s5qbg1exdn9n008azpf0q9))
