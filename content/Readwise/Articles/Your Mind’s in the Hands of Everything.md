# Highlights
- In the published version, when Lee asks Roth if he thinks his writing has had an impact on the culture, he replies, “No.” “If you ask if I *want* my fiction to change anything in the culture, the answer is still no.” He goes on:
  > What I want is to possess my readers while they are reading my book—if I can, to possess them in ways that other writers don’t. Then let them return, just as they were, to a world where everybody else is working to change, persuade, tempt, and control them.

- these novels gratified and complicated my intuition that people were not who they presented themselves to be, and that it was cruel on the part of society to punish its members for these incongruencies ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjdkk08rwemvshgx3as6r0g4))
- Unconsciously I lusted after an intimate relationship to language that could flourish outside of institutional life, where I hardly ever discovered the playfulness, sympathy, or kindness I craved. Still, few of the authors I read during those years captured my imagination and became my companion throughout adulthood the way Roth did ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjdkjxebhvdpr1922be226k1))
- I also formulated these questions of inheritance as a problem of influence. I can neither applaud nor dismiss the effects that Roth has had on my writing and on my life, and the fictional projections that his work helped set in motion long ago. So where did that leave me?

- Their Rothian idol is waxen and sweats at the slightest application of heat, yet they’d rather prop him up than mold him into something else ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjdm7enty3awxxmc2dzerwg1))
- Whatever I find distasteful and embarrassing,” she said, “I feel it’s embarrassing for the author.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjdm8j34q4eww9qtrptvjrgb))
- It’s when Roth gives to his female characters some of his own acuity, cruelty, lust, humor, and best lines that the constraints which keep them flattened and immobile within the narrative loosen. Then they are agents and sufferers of psychic mayhem, devils in their own right, unbound ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjdmebq1z33sk8s3q2ythtxh))
- This is, I suppose, my own ill-advised defense of literature, or at least my diagnosis of its challenges: that it is not moral instruction, nor a basic need akin to shelter and food, but rather a need like friends, adversaries, and love. Its function is social, even when we’re alone with it; it works only insofar as we can live with it, become vulnerable to it, or resist it.

- The festivities did not convince me that the weekend’s method of collective assessment and affirmation could chug along much longer—nor that a centennial celebration could predict the direction in which a reputation is headed. Roth is best sought in fits of astonishment on a subway bench or bed, “methinking methoughts.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjemmnmmrjss0jqjrayhs9e1))
