# Highlights
- They displayed a colourful array of metrics and diagrams, rating each horse’s pace, genealogy, experience and probability of winning the race. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hc9bw6pns4av5478fbvrp2x6))
- Horseracing in the US operates on a pari-mutuel system: all the money bet on a given race is put into a digital pool, the track takes a large cut (typically around 20 per cent) and the rest of the money is distributed to the winners.

- The pages list a horse’s name; owner, trainer and jockey; mother (dam) and father (sire); age; weight; sale price; dates and locations of all past races; times in those races at various points of call; relative position in the field at various points of call; the owner’s silk colours; a short qualitative note on each performance; and much else.

- In terms of mathematical sophistication, it was at best high school algebra,” Beyer told me of his arrival at the speed figure. “But it changed my life and, over time, it changed the game.” The approach became so ingrained that Beyer Speed Figures now appear in bold type in the Daily Racing Form, alongside every horse’s every race. The CAW syndicates, McKeever’s EquinEdge and many other recent projects are direct descendants of Beyer’s pencil-and-paper calculations.

- He has been involved with CAW teams, though he said he’s felt left behind by the “young guys” and their “black-box AI modelling”. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hc9m5ew0fdjgf2z66nycyr50))
    - Note: Wonder if I can find out what sort of AI? What about interpretability?
- Larmey described two broad strategies employed by CAWs. One is pure arbitrage. By closely monitoring the betting pools, one can sometimes spot naked inefficiencies — between the win and exacta pools, for example — and exploit them. The other is amassing gobs of data via existing databases and web-scraping, then analysing it to calculate a horse’s true odds and comparing that to its pari-mutuel price.

    - Note: Understand the latter strategy!
- CAW players are also infamous for placing their bets at the last possible second, just before the horses dash out of the gate, to learn as much information as they can about the opinions of the general public and, therefore, the price of their bets. The technical ability to do this at speed and scale is what a group like Elite Turf Club offers its members. As a result, the public often swallows large, last-second odds changes as the big money comes flooding in. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hc9m84c563na23qtxw1xh0ym))
    - Note: How is this truly reflecting the will of the people if it is changing—always representing a picture of the past?
- The best predictor of the win pool is the general public — just wisdom of the crowds.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hc9ma7p48pkqckeaw5ee0x9m))
