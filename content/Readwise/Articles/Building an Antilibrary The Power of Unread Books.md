# Highlights
- Read books are far less valuable than unread ones. The library should contain as much of what you do not know as your financial means, mortgage rates, and the currently tight real-estate market allows you to put there. You will accumulate more knowledge and more books as you grow older, and the growing number of unread books on the shelves will look at you menacingly. Indeed, the more you know, the larger the rows of unread books. Let us call this collection of unread books an antilibrary.

- For Umberto Eco, a private library is a research tool. The goal of an antilibrary is not to collect books you have read so you can proudly display them on your shelf; instead, it is to curate a highly personal collection of resources around themes you are curious about. Instead of a celebration of everything you know, an antilibrary is an ode to everything you want to explore. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01he2362depvdtvzxsxt39g2ss))
- Tsundoku (積ん読) is a beautiful Japanese word describing the habit of acquiring books but letting them pile up without reading them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01he5vez37fk85chtqt75tbqg1))

Remember that knowledge is a process, not a possession. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01he239g76ck5627nw9wghvr28))
