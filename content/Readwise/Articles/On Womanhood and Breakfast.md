# Highlights
- Somewhere between twelve and twenty-four I have come to understand that womanhood is not something one needs to endure; it is not the ache I have known so well, nor the self-inflicted misery I had accepted as a teenage girl, nor is it missing meals on purpose. To maintain this mindset that we are born to suffer is to be blind to the true strength and virtue of women and of ourselves. I recognize now that to put an end to this unnecessary self-inflicted pain is at its core an act of defiance; itâ€™s an affront to everything that wants us to hurt and to be small and to be pretty all the while.
