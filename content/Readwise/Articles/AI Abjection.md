- When we are disgusted we are challenged on an existential level. Abjection is an acid that corrodes the meanings of our worlds. “There,” Kristeva writes, “I am at the border of my condition as a living being.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrnmc36y2m51dgfd4xdcw4qw))
- The 2021 [*New York Times* *Magazine*](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/magazine/disgust-science.html) article “Disgust Explains Everything” reports that disgust is in charge of calibrating our neophobic (new-averse) tendencies with neophillic (novelty-seeking) desires.

    - Note: Even the comparison to sexual behaviors is a bit disgusting to me, lol.

- We can reject extractive or exploitative technologies because of our discernment or we can do so from our guts, our chests, our marrow: “I give birth to myself amid the violence of sobs, of vomit.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrnmmxhbweb8egs2xxjdn2yb))
    - Note: What makes one better than the other?
