# Highlights
- Brutalismus 3000 started the same way many great stories in Berlin do—at a bar in Neukölln in the early hours of the morning. What has unfolded in the aftermath is, above all else, an epic love story between Daldas and Zeitner, and between sensory-deprived, post-quarantine listeners and “nu gabber post-techno punk”—Brutalismus 3000’s self-coined, hybrid genre.

- The hippies of the 1960s famously [warned](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2948334) that “speed kills,” but at this frenetic moment in time, it saves. We are all addicted to stimulants and the proof is in our thumbs and forefingers, which scroll through feeds ever faster and incessantly open apps and inboxes, searching for the next hit of dopamine. The firehose of viral content that drowns us through our screens has left us numb. People, it seems, are less interested in “escaping” into techno—they’re looking for something that will help them wake the fuck up. Brutalismus 3000’s music is the sonic equivalent of intravenous amphetamine. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7vsjf5kdvbj01c5gfm6hc8v))
- CG: You both have such a relaxed approach to criticism. What would you say to an artist that is less confident about sharing their work because they fear judgment?
  VDD: I think the secret ingredient is controversy. If you are in peoples’ mouths and if they are trying to analyze you—even in a negative way—then they are interested in what you are doing.
  T: I mean there are so many great artists like Kafka who barely released anything. His best friend released his work after he died, and then he became one of the greatest authors of all time. I was never afraid to put anything out because, at the beginning, no one cared. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h7wnf1aywtj99zrg9e00cb89))
