- it’s the [builder](https://genagorlin.substack.com/p/the-builders-mindset-a-way-out-of), not the drill sergeant, who genuinely cares about excellence; for the builder’s excellence is in service of the particular life she wants to build, whereas the drill sergeant threatens you with “excellence” as a vague, arbitrary dictate you have to appease before being allowed to build and enjoy your own life in the first place ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjvqf5wbzwqgrmdv6jsfqbgc))

- This is the sense in which a dish is “perfect” if it achieves its aim of nourishing and delighting those who consume it, or that a home is “perfect” if it succeeds in fulfilling the physical and psychological and aesthetic needs of those who live in it.

- But it means they have the psychological wherewithal to maintain or quickly regain perspective on these various challenges, keeping their fundamental vision of life and of their own goals in view; and that they take action and ownership accordingly. Above all, it means they are on a constant trajectory of **building and growing*****:*** **of** **envisioning and vigorously pursuing ever-new heights of perfection in their work, their relationships, and, yes, their own psychology.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjvrcgs9q563js3hbhw5dq5d))
- But *none of these tacks in isolation fully leverages your agency over your own mind and character,* including the *mindsets you internalize (or de-internalize) over time.* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjvrfkmt2nw99kv4jfv6peqd))
- I conceive of human beings as fully capable of building, and re-building, themselves—motives, mindsets, emotions, action habits, and all. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjvrfvh3r26de09f6e1ysq7q))
