# Highlights
- We have a sense that the most important questions we can ask about a work of art are whether and to what extent it furthers extra-artistic aims, to what extent it serves a world outside itself. The idea that artists should make what they feel compelled to make, regardless of such considerations, that in fact art should be *protected* from responsibilities of this kind, seems part and parcel of a discredited Romantic model of the artist as exempt from workaday morality ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hfa0c1f9j3acqce6y84n9rhg))
- These responses sometimes seem to me an index of an anxiety I see more and more in my students, in my friends and myself, a kind of paranoia about our own moral status, a desire to demonstrate our personal righteousness in our response to art.

- Maybe it’s a delusion to think that the central activity of my life, art making, has more significance than digestion; maybe it’s a saving delusion. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hfa0dm2j15mv0tsv2w81g4t4))
- One reason a particular strain of our current moralism—the strain that would subject artists to tests of acceptability, that says we shouldn’t consume art made by bad people—is so dismaying is that it sees works of art as endlessly fungible, just another commodity on the market.

- This affinity is more mysterious than evaluation or ranking or canon-formation; it seems to me analogous to other relationships we form. The love I feel for my partner or my friends isn’t the result of comparative evaluation, it isn’t founded on a claim that of all candidates I’ve judged them worthiest. The question of comparison doesn’t enter; they are simply themselves, incommensurate, irreplaceable. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hfa0fm6wdvp4k7raf69d66tn))
- If a moral relationship means to live with or beside another in such a way as to recognize the value of their life as being equal to and independent of our own—that impossible, necessary Kantian standard—then passing judgment is the abrogation of that relationship: it destroys the reciprocity necessary for moral relation, it establishes a hierarchy utterly corrosive of it ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hfa0kdfbphv0s7b5d15bwvte))
- and passing judgment is a radically impoverished form of knowledge. An important part of the moral work of art is to teach us how much richer and more capacious our engagement with others can be. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hfaa54a08rax0z82wt5dad45))
- The moral seriousness of those books, it seems to me now, lies in their refusal of an image one might identify with in any frictionless, any merely self-comforting way. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hfaahawyfk7wq1jwfm3pep4m))
