## Highlights
- Cognitive capacities are often believed to be the result of the human mind/brain's ability to transform certain input states (e.g., sensations, perceptions, and concepts) into certain output states (e.g., inferences, decisions, plans, and overt responses). Cognitive scientists attempt to model such capacities by constructing precise characterizations of the hypothesized inputs and outputs of cognitive capacities as well as the functional mappings between them. This is what [David Marr (1982)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1080/03640210801897856#b60) called the *computational-level theory* of a cognitive process.

- The first part involves an informal thesis that I call the *Tractable Cognition thesis*: Human cognitive capacities are constrained by the fact that humans are finite systems with limited resources for computation. The second part involves a specific formalization of the Tractable Cognition thesis, what I call the *P-Cognition thesis*: Human cognitive capacities are *polynomial-time computable*.
