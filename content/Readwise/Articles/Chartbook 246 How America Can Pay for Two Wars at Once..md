# Highlights
- But given Israel’s wealth - it has a GDP of almost $500 billion - and technological sophistication and the weakness of its enemies, US aid is a matter of securing absolute dominance rather than survival. It serves political needs for both sides rather than military necessity. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdf80ee0whzjgbzw3hts64wa))
- This is basic Keynesian macroeconomics. Assuming there is some margin of available resources, or a willingness to redistribute resources between economic sectors, then, when it comes to major national priorities, budgetary constraints are never binding. Budgets are convenient fictions, defensive positions on which to fight political battles for and against “entitlements”, for instance, not real economic constraints.

- If we espouse the Keynesian vision we can no longer appeal to budgetary constraints to rule out options of which we disapprove. If one side favors war, or even two wars, or three, fiscal arithmetic does not stand in the way. What does are ethics, or politics or raison d’état.

- The question is not whether America can afford to funnel weapons into the war in Ukraine and to back Israel’s destruction of Hamas, but to what extent it should do so. The Keynesian logic is salutary because it forces us to face the political and strategic questions directly.

Insofar as there are limits on what America can deliver, they are not financial - dollars and cents - but industrial and logistical. How many weapons and munitions can the USA currently supply.

- Macabre as it is, what the “two war”-question revolves around is not dollars and cents, but physical production capacity. The rate limiting factor is the allocation of the scarce means of destruction. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdf89cr6p71pwz515m76za1j))
- And as left Keynesians always remind us, “we spend it on ourselves”, or to be more precise, we spend it on the fortunate recipients of government largesse. As the *FT* [reports](https://www.ft.com/content/ad8585de-a5c4-4d65-a213-596a10816aa8):
  > Shares in Lockheed, RTX, Northrop Grumman and General Dynamics — four of the Pentagon’s big contractors — have risen sharply since Hamas’s attack on October 7.
  What Wall Street sees in the crisis is “[opportunity](https://www.barrons.com/articles/lockheed-martin-boeing-northrop-defense-stock-price-d78064b)”. Public spending is private profit ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdf8a0zv85ta3wb0h3sqgks3))
