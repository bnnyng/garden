# Highlights
- In structured data where the input is essentially a table. And each column represents a feature that someone extracted from the unstructured data. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6s54n41nahrtjjesyz35sg6))
- In supervised learning, we have a training data set that consists of training examples and the corresponding labels, which are essentially the true answers.
  The training data set goes into the machine learning algorithm, which will process this data set to come up with a predictive model. And the output of this process is the trained model that we can then use on new data. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6s4tzyv477g7aghbddjh2ep))
- The process of feeding the training data into the machine learning algorithm and coming up with this predictive model is called training. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6s4vc6vtymf7wvpq5d2scc0))
- Once we have the trained model, we can feed it new observations or new data points, and it can then make predictions. This process of making new predictions is often also called inference. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6s4vksv1pcer2epxtncsx3g))
- Another example of supervised learning is regression. It's related to classification in the sense that we are given the true answer. However, in contrast to classification, we don't have a distinct label. We deal with a continuous value. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6s4rqpkmcjaanzfp9n7ked0))
- And to get to a structured dataset, a domain expert would have to look at this unstructured data and extract the features that go into these columns. We refer to this as manual feature engineering or manual feature extraction. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6s55gdwyh9vgsdcqtvk6vs3))
- Where deep learning really shines is when we work with unstructured data, while traditional and conventional machine learning algorithms are really good with tabular data or structured data. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6s559177angx4s371egtxxx))
- One type of supervised learning is called classification, which means predicting a class label. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6s4wavgn3zgctjgna3v7q4q))
