# Highlights
- Now, I submit that over this five to six year period children are displaying the most remarkable general purpose intelligence of any entity known to us, human, machine, or anything else. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk3tzk6pkdkca96akxk628rx))
- not only the knowledge that children gain is rich,
  but that the knowledge that they could have gained had they been born into a different culture differs from that quite dramatically in lots of ways ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk3v254hj8rkz2xwf3v37575))
- But if you look from one society to another or you look within our own society across historical time, what you see is enormous changes in the specific things that we know. And yet children could have been born into any of these different societies or at any different point in history, and they would have learned the local culture ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk3v2qj5ddf33j3wd3cw8bj1))
- children are capable of developing comprehensive, common sense knowledge not only fast, but flexibly. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk3v3yaafzf6jtkkhddqzy7k))
    - Note: Traditionally separate, solved separately in animals.
- core competence in at least six different domains ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk3v9m32rn81jaf97nznnpva))
    - Note: Note that these are all/mostly embodied.
- core knowledge systems are situated both above the peripheral systems and below our explicit conscious statable beliefs about the world. They occupy a middle ground between sensation
  and perception on the one hand and explicit belief on the other ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk3vcsf24senq3qtn8yeab65))
    - Note: System 1.5 thinking?
- So each system functions as a whole. And at its center are some very basic general abstract properties of the world. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk3vdnwaa4pdhsnx9n0gkv2s))
    - Note: Reference this list!
- core knowledge systems are profoundly limited. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk3ve2qp49pbfsy86ey74kpq))
- But when I say they're shared by other animals, I don't just mean human infants are able to represent objects and other animals, including infant animals, are able to represent objects. I mean that when we look at detail at the abstract concepts at the center of the systems, the limits to those systems, the brain systems that are activated by those systems,
  we see the same systems across different animals. I think this is the reason why most of what we've learned about human brains has come from studies of animal brains. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk3vj11eczzvn69t65tpksbq))
    - Note: Priors are evolutionary? But this doesn’t distinguish human reasoning from animal reasoning, maybe not the knowledge to focus on. Or is this true of all knowledge?
- And when you do that, you find that systems for representing entities in each of these domains, for representing persons, for example, are present and functional at the time
  of the infant's first encounter with another human being. So in this case at birth ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk3vnpnsf4xxed70gq3ggahj))
    - Note: Innate
- Studies of adults reveal, especially when
  we look at people's implicit abilities while they're focusing on some explicit task, we're asking, are we also seeing activation of these systems? And you see signature patterns showing systems that are at work and infants also continuing to function at older ages ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk3vp3ndqgd0zaza56c2vvcs))
- infants expect people and other agents to be able to set other objects in motion, but only when they contact them ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk3vsxamzgmyhakz9mm4755v))
- agents' actions are directed to goal objects ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk3vt4xs7zjr7n3dvkyn0h4g))
- they're attributing causal powers to agents at 11 months of age ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk3w0gjfmev7yqeev7zx1r96))
    - Note: Evolving causal power of agents?
- Now, I'm talking about this in terms of cost.
  But, of course, there's lots of physical variables that distinguish the more costly action from the other one ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk3w5gcghp729z241dmvrre1))
    - Note: Embodiment gives cues … same data for agents?
- initial reason to think that what infants are doing here is not just learning about local cues
  to object value, but rather computing object value by appealing to some more abstract notion of cost ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk3w7b96fdbhrgjbgbpt5rnj))
- if you give infants a brief session where you put on them mittens that have Velcro attached to them that allow them to pick up objects on contact,
  and then you show them those events where another person wearing the same mittens is reaching for the different objects, now the infants succeed ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk3wbggpjrss2j26y8vtv7wv))
- after that happens when they see that mitten on another person,
  they now encode the reaching the way the older infants do as being object directed ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk3wbsc56aewbk4r2qw8fx23))
    - Note: What! Very interesting implications for embodiment again!
- What was the mittens experience doing for the three-month-old infants? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk3whgjzg11tndgjwbz7g49r))
- They discovered that the effect of the mittens on perception of goal-directed action only occurred if they were watching an actor who was also wearing the same mittens and reaching for the same object that the infant had been reaching for. When the study was repeated with an actor who wasn't wearing mittens or an actor who was wearing mittens, but reached for a different object,
  then the mittens had no effect. And the babies failed just as badly as they did with no mittens training ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk3wjpn6fqqa28yaw5z147zj))
- there may be another action that they do understand, the simple causal relationship of action on contact. What may happen is that wearing sticky mittens turns an otherwise inscrutable reaching event into a much more
  easy to understand contact event where you simply touch an object, and it moves on contact. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk3wn8xbh4wa9356wmj41x9s))
- The prediction that it tests is that, if the effect of mittens is to turn a complicated reaching event into a simple case of action on contact, then it should be possible to get success out of a three-month-old infant without giving them reaching
  experience simply by giving them visual information for this causal relationship of action on contact ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk3wnn2p7wqxkvwhdewshby1))
- So it looks like at three months of age, before infants understand what reaching is, before they can pick up objects and manipulate them, they have interconnected abstract concepts of cost
  and causality-- that under conditions in which an agent causes a change in the state of the world, they do so by acting on the object whose state they are changing on contact ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk3wx818bsad8tqktw7s1pyt))
- So they know really virtually nothing of the specifics about how you act on objects. But they do seem to have this ability to represent objects and reason about them in ways that capture these abstract relationships at their core. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk3wztj5p1qmkebf6s70jtp7))
- each of these systems operates as a unitary whole
  distinct from the other systems. So they operate under different conditions. They can capture different properties of the world. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk3x0sk52mgr7z6a8q4x6rev))
- None of the core knowledge systems seem to be unique to our species. So it's an early emerging and ancient system ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk3x7ad7sndgmdfc0x378fhw))
    - Note: So not the secret to human supremacy…
- key property that I think connects them all is the fact that these systems are ancient ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk5v33gse03n0hygth6ye45q))
- Between that ancestor and us, for that system to have persisted, it can't have been tied to the specific perceptible properties of the animals' environment ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk5v3sbws37tn8y84vg4tqyv))
- But when cognitive systems center on highly abstract properties, the thing about those abstract properties is, if they're true of one environment, they're true of all of them. So every navigable layout is going to be approximately Euclidean. Every animal is going to be capable of causing its own motion and, by moving, causing changes in the world. Every object, whether large or small, whatever it's made of, is going to move. If it moves, it will move on spatiotemporally connected paths.
  These abstract properties will apply in all environments ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk5v4cbpqqsdywfxmdr8srft))
- But if the ancient system is relatively encapsulated, then it could, in principle at least, survive changes in other parts of the central nervous system. So I think ancient and enduring brain systems that function robustly are likely to be encapsulated ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk5v4zrdr2eye08wvfctf31b))
- how did children go beyond core knowledge and gain the capacity to acquire all of the common sense knowledge that develops over the first five years ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk5v7k0pf07c1991p8t3f7zv))
- And the best predictor of who was going to behave like a 12-month-old, were the parents' reports of whether they knew the names of these kinds of objects. Kids whose parents said they knew the words duck and shoe were more likely to succeed than those whose parents didn't ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk5v9knpjjhbqcr9zxnhfjgw))
- She found that by labeling them either with the correct names or with nonsense words, but in a syntactically legal context-- like, look, a blicket. Look, a toma. She could flip them from failing this task to succeeding. When she used two different words,
  they succeeded on this task. When she used a single word two different times, they did not, OK? So the use of language in this task flipped the kids ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk5vat4pj07g3ed2fre7shv1))
- Now, in further studies she showed that babies not only expect two objects when they hear two words at nine months. They expect those two objects to have different forms and functions ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk5vbcvha6npn3qpt37nm0eq))
- I think these words are appearing in noun phrases whose meaning comes from three different systems of core knowledge ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk5vbze93n2404w23a98qqan))
- But the language that people are using, not because they're trying to teach infants anything, but simply because they're ordinary speakers who obey natural language pragmatics, that language is giving infants information about how many things are out there and what their properties are. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk5vds0b3g5t5a4mmn1k7qm2))
- what learning a natural language may give children is a unique system for composing new concepts from core concepts ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk5vhy4fn1bxjz6hqzbcjbmd))
- that ability comes from I think three properties
  of the system-- that any natural language has an open-ended lexicon. It's got a relatively small set of rules for forming expressions by ordering the items in the lexicon. And the rules depend only on the grammatical form of the lexical items, not on their meanings. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk5vj56wkpkzznn7hdsmcjz0))
- When you learn a new word, you become able to understand not only the sentence in which you learn that word, but in infinitely many other sentences that you can compose using that word. The meanings of the expressions come from the meanings of the words together with the rules for combining them to form of the expression ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk5vkdc31h4tsf14dqzrp46a))
- a critical property of natural languages
  is the way that speakers use language. They use language to speak economically. They use it to be informative-- good speakers don't tell you things they think you already know-- and to be relevant to the situation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk5vkx4wc0082khgxc2t04wf))
- most of word learning isn't happening by ostension, by pointing to some entity in the world that that word names. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk5vmev7d1ybkwxqfrgces85))
- kind concepts or why the arguments against language as the key to our cognitive flexibility are wrong ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk5vps3102mj9ag5yfhxhmyt))
    - Note: Look into!
- If you need to render an object, you need a detailed representation of its perceptible properties. But that doesn't need to be inputted to the physics engine. You can economize a lot by simply representing an object as a body of indeterminate shape, color, other properties in a particular location with a particular mass ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk5vyxrmnknxm3kkptg2dnr5))
- the infants in the Shu and Carey experiments are economizing in similar ways. They're tracking objects behind an occluder, not by simulating the movements of the detailed distinctive properties of the duck and the shoe, but rather just blob going in here, blob going in here. And that can account both for their successes and for their failures ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk5vze2b0r3wnta837vn9d9b))
- systems that simulate paths through the environment might train the brain to prepare it
  for the task of real navigation in the environment, a task that an animal has to be able to succeed at the very first time they navigate ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk5w1zzexjj4h3580pn62fm2))
    - Note: One shot
- prenatal simulations from generative models that we inherit from those distant common ancestors may account both for how infants are able to show sensitivity
  to abstract properties of the world the first time they encounter an object or an agent or a place in the environment, how they're able to do that, and also why they might be so insensitive to the more specific properties of those things that you need perceptual systems to detect ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk5w31srvf96zq0jxhbh7nf7))
    - Note: What models, mental models?
- Can we come to understand our own minds both as they develop in children and in us
  as adults well enough that we can start making intelligent predictions in advance about what kinds of new technologies are actually going to be good for us, make us happier, make us function better, make us smarter, and what kinds of technologies are going to get us into trouble? And for any given technology, how can we design them to make them truly a useful addition to our immense cultural repertoire?
