# Highlights
- Our goal in this chapter is to illustrate the kinds of computational models of cognition that we can build if we assume that human learning and inference approximately follow the principles of Bayesian probabilistic inference, and to explain some of the mathematical ideas and techniques underlying those models.

- how does the human mind go beyond the data of experience? In other words, how does the mind build rich, abstract, veridical models of the world given only the sparse and noisy data that we observe through our senses? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk7cegxjgbe16qsxznvbt8gf))
- Vision researchers are interested in how the mind infers the intrinsic properties of a object (e.g., its color or shape) as well as its role in a visual scene (e.g., its spatial relation to other objects or its trajectory of motion).

    - Note: Spelke says core knowledge. Just a human ability?
