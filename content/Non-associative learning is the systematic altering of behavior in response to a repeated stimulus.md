Unlike in [[Conditioning is the learned association between a behavior and an unrelated stimulus|conditioning]], non-associative learning does not pair behavior with stimuli.

There are two types of non-associative learning: **habituation** is the decrease in a behavioral response after repeated exposure; **sensitization**, the opposite, is an increase in response after repeated exposure.
