Self-generated learning occurs when a learning system behaves to generate useful data for a particular context. A domain-general learning system should be able to shape their future experiences and enhance learning across a wide variety of contexts.

One example of self-generated learning is in human development. Children physically interact with and explore their environment to learn about the world. These actions include picking up and examining objects, and tracking parentsâ€™ gaze.

According to the [[Interventionist theory of causation]], the data created in self-generated learning is most effective for determining causal relationships (i.e., forming scientific explanations) in the world.
