In [[Human development (cognitive science)]], infants’ grow their brains and bodies over longer periods while performing “intermediate-term patterns of exploration.” These patterns include feedback that assists further learning (see: [[Strange loops]], [[Interventionist theory of causation]]).

In AI systems, network performance is improved by implementing fast, modular “System 1” thinking and slow, more generalized “System 2” thinking (see: [[reinforcement-learning-fast-and-slow]]).

Most neural networks lack this property.
