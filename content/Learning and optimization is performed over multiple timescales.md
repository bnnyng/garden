As discussed during [[@2022millhouse|Millhouse et al. (2022)]], learning and optimization is performed over multiple timescales:
- **Evolutionary timescales** allow brains to be capable of learning from the environment in the first place.
- **Developmental timescales** involve learning that occurs as the brain and body develop.
- **Short timescales** involve acquiring specific knowledge and skills.

For example, infant learning happens at both developmental and short timescales: infants grow their brains and bodies over longer periods while performing “intermediate-term patterns of exploration,” which include feedback that assists further learning (see: [[Interventionist theory of causation]]). Most neural networks lack this property of human development.

Similarly, while analyzing the cultural practice of [[Deductive dialogues are Prover-Skeptic games, after Dutilh Novaes|dialogical deduction]], [[@2020dutilhnovaes|Dutilh Novaes (2020)]] describes how human cultural practices develop at three different timescales: phylogenetic, historical, and ontogenetic. She notes that “an encompassing account of a particular aspect of human cognition and the extent to which it is shaped by cultural processes must arguably tackle all three timescales.”
