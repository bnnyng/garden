## Highlights
- Let all men know that grace comes after tribulation. Let them know that without the burden of afflictions it is impossible to reach the height of grace. Let them know that the gifts of grace increase as the struggles increase ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hgbnezmwvc258kfbjc98xxqg))
- She could be accused, like St Rose of Lima or Lana del Rey, of romanticising suffering without really understanding the condition of someone trapped by it. But I think it’s more that Weil thought with her entire being. Her intellectual experiments required commiting her entire lifestyle to a proposition to explore whether there was any truth to it. Her thought was fundamentally experiential, governed above all by her encounters with supernatural grace ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hgbnneh8scs8ty15c6adjx52))

- The only ethical life risks living unethically. It accepts the risk that the very faculties that allow moral and rational life may be corrupted. The Christian entering the gladatorial arena could, at the last moment, be consumed by the terror of death and lash out in wild panic, killing her persecutors. It’s only by risking this possibility and enduring in faith until the end that she becomes a martyr. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hgbp190sc4bm2f0xg2sc2whw))
