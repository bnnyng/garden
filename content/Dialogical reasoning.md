# Literature notes

#### [[@2020dutilhnovaes]]

- **Dialogical interactions between mathematicians often begin as a request for help:** “True enough, these dialogues do not always correspond neatly to Prover–Skeptic dialogues, in particular in that *they often start with a question or a request for help* … Nevertheless, once a candidate proof or argument is put forward, those involved in the interaction will presumably behave as Skeptics, looking for possible flaws or steps in the proof which remain obscure.”

- **The two functions of reason:**
	- “A first function of reason is to provide tools for the kind of rich and versatile coordination that human cooperation requires. By giving reasons in order to explain and justify themselves, people indicate what motivates…and justifies their ideas and actions. In so doing, *they let others know what to expect and implicitly indicate what they expect of others*.”
	- “The second function of reason—a function carried out through *reasoning and argumentation*—is…to make communication effective even when the communicators lack sufficient credibility in the eyes of their audience to believed on trust.”
- **The purpose of reasoning is to justify oneself and convince others; reasoning has a “normal environment”:** “\[Most psychologists] maintain that the main function of reasoning is to enhance individual cognition—a task it performs abysmally. … It makes sense…for a cognitive mechanism aimed at justifying oneself and convincing others to be biased and lazy. … When people disagree but have a common interest in finding the truth or the solution to a problem exchange arguments with each other, *the best idea tends to win*.” 
- **Traditional theories of why and how reasoning is performed:** “\[*Why?*] The goal of reasoning … is that of coming to new conclusions not through mere observation or through the testimony of others but by drawing these conclusions from information already available to us. … \[*How?*] The process of reasoning consists in attending to reasons for adopting new conclusions.”
- **Reasoning is an inference process that attends to reasons:** “Following Hume’s example, we will use the term ‘inference’ for the extraction of new information from information already available, whatever the process. We will reserve the term ‘reasoning’ for the particular process of pursuing this goal by *attending to reasons.*”
	- “Psychologists, for instance, often use the word ‘reasoning’ to describe the remarkable inferences that animals and infants tend to be making.”

- Stages of mathematical discovery: primitive conjecture, proof, “global counterexamples,” identification of the “guilty lemma” that the counterexample *locally* refutes, and updating the conjecture to include new assumptions.
