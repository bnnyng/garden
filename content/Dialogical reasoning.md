The stages of mathematical discovery, according to [Lakatos (1976)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proofs_and_Refutations):
1. Primitive conjecture.
2. Proof.
3. “Global” counterexamples.
4. Identification of the “guilty lemma” for which the global counterexample acts as a *local* counterexample, and updating of the conjecture to include new assumptions.
