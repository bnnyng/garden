According to [[1878-perice-the-fixation-of-belief|Peirce (1878)]], there are three key distinctions between states of doubt and states of belief:
- Doubt, which indicates when we are asking a question, and belief, which indicates when we are forming a judgement, are different sensations;
- Doubt does not guide our actions, while belief establishes habits that lead to actions;
- Doubt is an uncomfortable and dissatisfied state, while belief is a calm state that we do not wish to change.

>The irritation of doubt is the only immediate motive for the struggle to attain belief. â€¦ With the doubt, therefore, the struggle begins, and with the cessation of doubt it ends. Hence, the sole object of inquiry is the settlement of opinion.
