>[!abstract] Theorem: Heine-Borel in one dimension
>Suppose $D \in \mathbb R$ is [[Open sets|closed]] and [[Supremum and infimum|bounded]] both above and below. Then any [[Sequences|sequence]] $x_n \in D$ has a subsequence $x_k^\prime = x_{n_k}$ so that $x^\prime_k \to x$ is a convergent sequence, with limit $x \in D$.

- Statement from [[MATH-42X|MATH 425]]: A subset of $\mathbb R^d$ (Euclidean space, equipped with Euclidean metric) is compact *if and only if* it is closed and bounded.
