>[!abstract] Theorem (Rudin 2.41): Heine-Borel
>Let $A\subseteq \mathbb R^n$. Then the following are equivalent:
>- (i) $A$ is [[Closed sets, closures, and dense subsets|closed]] and [[Bounded sets and functions|bounded]];
>- (ii) $A$ is [[Compact sets|compact]], meaning every open cover of $A$ has a finite subcover;
>- (iii) $A$ is **limit point compact**, meaning every *infinite* subset $E \subseteq A$ has a [[Limits and accumulation points|limit point]] in $E$.

>[!abstract] Theorem: Heine-Borel in one dimension
>Suppose $D \in \mathbb R$ is [[Open sets|closed]] and [[Bounded sets and functions|bounded]] both above and below. Then any [[Sequences|sequence]] $x_n \in D$ has a subsequence $x_k^\prime = x_{n_k}$ so that $x^\prime_k \to x$ is a convergent sequence, with limit $x \in D$.
