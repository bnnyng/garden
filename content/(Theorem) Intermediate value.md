>[!abstract] Theorem: Intermediate value
>Let $f : [a,b] \to \mathbb R$ be continuous. Suppose $f(a) \leq f(b)$, and $y_0 \in \mathbb R$ has $f(a) \leq y_0 \leq f(b)$. Then there exists some $c \in [a,b]$ so that $f(x) = y_0$.

As a corollary, we see that The function $f: [0, \infty) \to [0, \infty)$ defined as $f(x) = x^n$ is a [[Algebra of functions|bijection]], so its [[Invertibility|inverse]] $g(x) = x^{1/n}$ is defined.
