# Overview

Recall the definition of a [[Continuous functions|continuous function]] between [[Topological spaces and open sets|topological spaces]]. 

![[Continuous functions#^9fa13a]]

A homeomorphism is a ‚Äú[[Injectivity, surjectivity, and bijectivity|bijective]] correspondence‚Äù between collections of open sets in different topological spaces; that is, a function that is continuous, bijective, and has a continuous inverse.

>[!example] Definition: Homeomorphism, homeomorphic
>A function between [[Topological spaces and open sets|topological spaces]] $f : X \to Y$ is a **homeomorphism** if $f$ is [[Continuous functions|continuous]], bijective, and its inverse $f^{-1} : X \to Y$ is continuous.
>
>$X, Y$ are **homeomorphic** if there exists a homeomorphism between them, and we write $X \cong Y$. Equivalently, we have $X \cong Y$ if there exists continuous functions $f : X \to Y$, $g : Y \to X$ such that $g \circ f = \text{id}_X$ and $f \circ g = \text{id}_Y$.

Crucially, since homeomorphisms give correspondences between *collections of open sets* in topological spaces, any **topological property** on one space (i.e., a property that can be entirely expressed in terms of the topology on the space) can be used to express the corresponding property on another, homeomorphic space.

Homeomorphisms, which preserve *topological structure*, are analogous to [[Isomorphism|isomorphisms]] in algebra, which are bijective correspondences that preserve *algebraic structure*. However, while a isomorphism‚Äîor bijective homomorphism‚Äîin algebra is guaranteed to have an inverse that is also a homomorphism, a continuous function in topology is NOT guaranteed to have a continuous inverse.

# Embeddings

>[!example] Definition: Topological embedding
>A function between [[Topological spaces and open sets|topological spaces]] $f: X \to Y$ is an **embedding** if it is [[Continuous functions|continuous]], injective, and the restriction of its range to the image of $f$, the function $f‚Äô : X \to f(X)$ defined by $x \mapsto f(x)$ is a homeomorphism.

# Examples of homeomorphisms

#wip See homeworks

#### All circles are homeomorphic 


#### Stereographic projections

We have 
$$
\mathbb R^n \cong S^n \backslash \{ N\}
$$
where $N$ is the ‚Äúnorth pole‚Äù of the the $n + 1$ dimensional unit sphere $S^n$. The associated homeomorphism is $\mathbf i : \mathbb R^n \to S^n \backslash \{ N\}$ defined by
$$
\mathbf i (x) = (t(x)x_1, \ldots, t(x)x_n, 1-t(x)),
\quad \quad \quad
t(x) = \frac{1}{1 + x^2_1 + \cdots + x_n^2},
$$
and the inverse is $f : S^n \backslash \{ N\} \to \mathbb R^n$ defined by 
$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{1- x_{n+1}} (x_1, \cdots, x_n).
$$
üî∫ *Exercise.* Check this is a homeomorphism.

# Review

- Is a [[Continuous functions|continuous]] bijection necessarily a homeomorphism? Give an example.
