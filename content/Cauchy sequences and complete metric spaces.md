Cauchy sequences are closely related to [[Sequences|convergent sequences]]; however, a Cauchy sequence has terms that are getting closer and closer to each other, while a convergent sequence has terms that are approaching some fixed limit value. In other words, the key difference is that the [[Limits and accumulation points|limit]] is explicitly involved in the definition of convergence, but not in the definition of a Cauchy sequence.

>[!example] Definition: Complete metric space
>We say a [[Metrics, metric spaces, and the metric topology|metric space]] $(X, d)$ is **complete** if every Cauchy sequence in $X$ [[Sequences|converges]].

>[!abstract] Theorem:
>Let $(X, d)$ be a [[Compactness|compact]] [[Metrics, metric spaces, and the metric topology|metric space]]. Then a sequence $(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb N}$ in $X$ is Cauchy if and only if it [[Sequences|converges]].

# Review

- Prove or justify the following facts:
	- Cauchy sequences are [[Bounded sets and functions|bounded]] (hint: choose $N$ that satisfies the definition of boundedness).
	- [[Sequences|Convergent sequences]] are Cauchy (hint: choose $N$ that satisfies the definition of Cauchy).
	- Cauchy does not imply convergence.

*Proof*.

Since $(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb N}$ is Cauchy, there exists $N \in \mathbb N$ such that for all $n, m > N$, we have $d(x_n, x_m) < 1$. In particular, we know $d(x_N, x_n) < 1$ for all $n > N$. Set 
$$
R = \text{max}\{ 1, \ d(x_N, x_n) : n < N\}.
$$
Then for all $n \in \mathbb N$, we have $d(x_N, x_n) \leq R$, so $(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb N}$ is bounded.
