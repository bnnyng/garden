In “[[2024-dedeo-alephzero-and-mathematical-experience|AlephZero and Mathematical Experience]],” DeDeo explores the possibility of [[Glitches|glitches]] in [[automated proof systems]] to create mathematical objects with entirely unprecedented properties, proofs “whose **aboutness** has detached from the constraints of an idea” but are subjects of inquiry due to human interest in their structural features, etc.

>[!quote] From “[[2024-dedeo-alephzero-and-mathematical-experience|AlephZero and Mathematical Experience]]”:
>Such objects would be unusual in mathematical culture: created not for the purposes of answering to human intuition, they would possess, nevertheless, a derivative intentionality, a complexity that emerged from the systems we ourselves created.
