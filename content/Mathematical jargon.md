- **Definition** = a new name and a description of "what properties must hold" for an object with that name
- **Proposition** = a claim that follows a set of axioms with a proof that shows it's true
- **Lemma** = "mini-proposition" that is proven on the way to establishing a bigger, more important proposition
- **Theorem** = "mega-proposition" that is particularly important and noteworthy
- **Corollary** = a small consequence of a theorem which doesn't take much effort to prove, either following directly from the theorem or from the theorem combined with other established facts
