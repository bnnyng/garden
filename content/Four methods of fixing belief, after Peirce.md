[[1878-peirce-the-fixation-of-belief|Peirce (1878)]] identifies four methods of fixing belief: tenacity, authority, reasoning *a priori*, and science. The method of science is superior to others because it is the only one that requires belief to coincide with reality.

| Method of tenacity  | When an individual sticks arbitrarily to one view, such that truth becomes private and individual. Note that because this method relieves the discomfort of doubt, it is not fully *ir*rational. | - Maintains individual peace of mind by removing doubt                                                                     | - Inconvenient when beliefs do not align with practical outcomes<br>- Challenged if one accepts that others’ thoughts can be equal to one’s own                                                                             |
| Method of authority | When an institution specifies and teaches valid beliefs, suppressing any contrary thoughts.                                                                                                      | - Fixes belief in a community, rather than a mere individual<br>- “Mental and moral superiority” to the method of tenacity | - Inevitably leads to humankind’s worst atrocities and cruelties<br>- Will always be “intellectuals” in society that prevent its absolute efficacy                                                                          |
| Method of apriority | When conclusions are drawn from “agreeable” foundational premises that are not directly observed. Examples include metaphysical philosophy, conceptions of art.                                  | - “More intellectual and respectable” than the previous methods                                                            | - Similar to the method of authority, belief depends on accidental circumstances (in society), and therefore does not eliminate doubt<br>- [[A priori reasoning makes inquiry like the development of taste, after Peirce]] |
| Method of science   | When truth is reached by perceiving “Reals” whose characteristics do not depend on human opinion.                                                                                                | - Facts depend on “external permanencies”<br>- No doubt arises from its practice                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
