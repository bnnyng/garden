[Fee & Goldberg (2011)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22015923/) showed that songbirds learning songs implement [[Reinforcement learning|reinforcement learning]] at the circuit level, which involves individual connections between neurons. They showed the following differences:

| Biological system                                                                                 | Machine system             | 
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Many distinct rewards corresponding to spatially separate circuits in the brain                   | Single “monolithic reward” |
| Reinforcers are internally generated; for songbirds, based on comparison to “tutor song” template | Reinforcers are engineered |
