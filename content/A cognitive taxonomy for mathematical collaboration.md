## Dialogical reasoning

## Explanation

#### [[2019-pease-et-al-explanation-in-mathematical-conversations]]

## Impasse
#### [[2024-dedeo-alephzero-and-mathematical-experience]]

- **Impasse anchors judgements in value:** “Mathematicians have a different way of making sense of importance: rather than asking the (somewhat nonsensical) question “how much would it matter if such-and-such a theorem, known to be true, was actually false”, they can use their experiences of impasse and resolution as guides for which theorems to value.”
	- **Determining importance via counterfactuals does not make sense with a deductive system like mathematics.**
- **Errors are a source of insight:** “If, by contrast, we believe we can experience errors of logic as having mathematical meaning—if we are willing to say, for example, that one can assert falsehoods while making progress—we must also grant that *some essential aspect of the activity goes beyond the formalist picture enforced by a proof assistant*. In as much as automated methods help us be wrong less often, in other words, they foreclose an aspect of the mathematical experience.”

# Log

[[2024-08-02]]

- From [[2017-mercier-sperber-the-enigma-of-reason]]
	- Reasoning is for *justifying oneself and convincing others* – possible cognitive category for finding more words?

- Thoughts from Simon on [[2019-pease-et-al-explanation-in-mathematical-conversations]]

```
This paper is focusing on a particular kind of move (explanation). We expect there to be other moves that people are making — e.g., people talking about intuitions, people being surprised, people making judgements about what is promising (i.e., strategizing about the next step), people doing raw calculations to check guesses, people providing examples.

If we were to go back to our earlier attempts, perhaps with enlarged word lists (e.g., the stuff listed in Ref 57, 58), we could basically produce our own taxonomy. We’d be data-driven more than they were, but I think we could give a pretty good account of the moves we expect to find ahead of time.

1. Explanation (from their paper — either “trace” or “strategic” explanation.)
2. Surprise/Expectation (from Gower’s paper on quasi-Bayesian methods, miracles, coincidences).
3. Planning/Attack Strategy (what people consider “promising”, or not promising, as a next step, also some of that “lit review” stuff you found.)
4. Deduction (the actual production of logical chains — e.g., maybe stuff Kristal is doing)
5. Examples/Empirical (the creation of test cases, including people reporting on their Maple/MATLAB tests)
6. Difficulty/Impasse (people talking about getting stuck? — some material on this in my AlephZero paper)
7. Interpersonal (anything to do with making sense of someone else trying to do 1-6 — e.g., if someone does planning move, there might be a follow-up with someone else trying to understand that move — the “mental modeling of someone else’s mental model”).

We could say “these are the moves we expect to find, on the basis of the literature” — in each case, there will be citations we can make to people, either in philosophy of mathematics, or in cog sci of collaboration for #7. Then we can go do the topic analysis and see what comes up — what we were doing before we kind of gave up.

- Initial set of cognitive topics with Simon and Marina, based on 10-topic model
	- However, quiz suggested poor inter-rater reliability

```
0. Brainstorming approaches & gaining motivation from elsewhere (e.g. external textbooks, etc)  
1. Exploratory deductive: reflecting on the already proposed ideas & restating the problem/solutions & deducing the conclusions (interpersonal)
2. Computed the result
3. Deducing by contradiction
4. Open questions & possibilities
5. ?
6. Inductive, intuitions
7. Considering someone else's point, (inductive) reasoning through possibilities (interpersonal)
8. ? Examples, uncertainty, planning (interpersonal)
9. Correcting errors (interpersonal)
