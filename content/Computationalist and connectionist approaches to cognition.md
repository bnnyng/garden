The approach to cognition as information processing is called **computationalism**. According to computationalism, thoughts and behaviors are produced by constructing **representations**, or meaningful units, and manipulating them using **formal computations**.

In contrast to computationalism, **connectionism** or **parallel distributed processing** treats mental activity as distributed, simultaneous signal activity. [[§ Deep Learning|Artificial neural networks]] are an implementation of connectionist theory.
