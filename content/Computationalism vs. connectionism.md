The **computationalist** approach to the mind treats mental activity as formal operations (i.e., syntactical rules) on symbols and mental models. This is the classical view in cognitive science.

The alternative to computationalism is **connectionism** or **parallel distributed processing**, which treats mental activity as distributed, simultaneous signal activity. [[ยง Deep learning|Artificial neural networks]] are an implementation of connectionist theory.

Fodor & Pylyshyn (1988) suggest that the classical view expands computationalism:

>Connectionist theories \[understand mind using] only causal connectedness as a primitive relation among \[distributed processing units]. 
>
>Classical theories acknowledge not only causal relations among the semantically evaluable objects that they posit, but also a range of structural relations.

Note that computationalists are not concerned with whether the relationships between nodes are semantically evaluable; examples of such relationships include constituency and logical rules.
