>[!quote] From Scott Aaronson, quoted in [[2023-viteri-dedeo-epistemic-phase-transitions|Viteri & DeDeo (2023)]]
>\[A] step-by-step logical deduction tends to be seen as merely the vehicle for dragging the reader or listener, kicking and screaming, toward a **gestalt switch** in perspective—a switch that, once you’ve succeeded in making it, makes the statement in question (and more besides) totally obvious and natural and it couldn’t ever have been otherwise. *The logical deduction is necessary, but the gestalt switch is the point*. This, I think, explains the feeling of certainty that mathematicians express once they’ve deeply internalized something—they’re not multiplying out probabilities of an oversight in each step, they’re describing the scenery from *a new vantage point that the steps helped them reach* (after which the specific steps should be modified or discarded).

>[!question] #concept-question What does the last part mean, to modify or discard specific steps—information compression that only preserves the feeling of confidence?
