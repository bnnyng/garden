| Characteristics | Compresses information to explain some aspect of reality; reductive, but also selective about what information to keep or discard (related: [[2-SOMEDAY/Renormalization\|Renormalization]]). | An “oracle” with a notion of accuracy; profligate with informational inputs. |
| Examples        | Scientific and [[All models are wrong, but some are useful\|mathematical modeling]]                                                                                                          | [[§ Machine learning]]                                                       |
