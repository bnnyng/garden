# Complete ordered fields


>[!example] Definition: Complete ordered field
>A **complete** ordered field $(\mathbb F, + , \cdot, <)$ is an [[Order relations on sets and fields|ordered field]] satisfying the “[[Supremum and infimum|least upper bound]] property”: if $S \subset \mathbb F$ is bounded above and $S \neq \emptyset$, then $S$ has a least upper bound.

See also: [[(Theorem) There exists a unique isomorphism between two complete ordered fields]]

# Completeness in metric spaces

>[!example] Definition: Complete set
>A set $X$ in a [[Metrics and metric spaces|metric space]] $(X, d)$ is **complete** if every [[Cauchy sequence]] in $X$ converges to a point in $X$.
