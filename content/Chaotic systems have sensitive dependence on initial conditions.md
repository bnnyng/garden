In chaotic systems, even tiny uncertainties in measurements of initial conditions (i.e., position and momentum) can lead to exponentially larger errors in long-term predictions about the system. 

Chaotic systems disprove a deterministic theory of the universe, in which every phenomenon can be perfectly predicted by the laws of mechanics.
