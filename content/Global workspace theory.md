The “global workspace” theory of higher-level human reasoning is the idea that the brain is divided into specialized [[The mind is comprised of interacting, interpretable modules|cognitive modules]], which compete to broadcast information in a shared “workspace.” That is, the limited workspace acts as an information bottleneck. This information is then globally broadcasted.

From [[2022-sfi-embodied-situated-and-grounded-intelligence]]:
>Because different modules can take alternatively take the mic, so to speak, this also pushes cognition toward sequential processing. Further, individual modules must encode their outputs in a way that allows other modules to utilize these outputs. The result is that cognition combines thoughts into a task-appropriate sequence for processing incoming information.
