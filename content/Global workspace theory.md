The “global workspace” theory of higher-level human reasoning is the idea that the brain is divided into specialized [[The mind is comprised of interacting, interpretable modules|cognitive modules]], which compete to broadcast information in a shared conscious “workspace.” The limited workspace acts as an information bottleneck. This information is then globally broadcasted to be stored in short-term [[Memory]], and actions and perceptions.

From [[2022-sfi-embodied-situated-and-grounded-intelligence]]:
>Because different modules can take alternatively take the mic, so to speak, this also pushes cognition toward sequential processing. Further, individual modules must encode their outputs in a way that allows other modules to utilize these outputs. The result is that cognition combines thoughts into a task-appropriate sequence for processing incoming information.

The bottleneck forces sequential processing like that associated with [[System 1 and System 2 thinking|System 2]] thinking, which includes conscious reasoning, planning, and imagination.
