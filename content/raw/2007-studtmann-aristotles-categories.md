# Highlights
## The ten-fold division

#### Aristotle vs. Plato

**The primary substances are material particulars.**
> Aristotle’s categorialism is firmly anti-Platonic. Whereas **Plato treated the abstract as more real than material particulars**, in the Categories **Aristotle takes material particulars as ontological bedrock** — to the extent that being a primary substance makes something more real than anything else. 

**The more general substances are secondary.**
> Moreover, among secondary substances, those at a lower level of generality are what Aristotle calls ‘prior in substance’ than those at a higher level (2b7). So, for instance, human is prior in substance than body. Whether this is to be interpreted in terms of the greater reality of the kind human is an open question. Nonetheless, Aristotle’s equating an **increase in generality** with a **decrease in substantiality** is at least in spirit strongly anti-Platonic.

#### Homonymy and "being"

**Homonyms express a relation that is not a genus.**
> According to Aristotle, some words do not express a genus but instead are what he calls pros hen homonyms — that is, homonyms related to one thing. ... Such words are applicable to various items in the world in virtue of the fact that those items all bear some type of relation to some one thing or type of thing.

**Being is not itself a genus, but made out of relation to the primary substance.**
> In this case, a regimen, urine, and Socrates are all called ‘healthy’ not because they stand under some one genus, namely healthy things, but instead because they all bear some relation to health. Similarly, according to Aristotle, **things in the world are not beings because they stand under some genus, being, but rather because they all stand in a relation to the primary being,** which in the Categories he says is substance.

**Being is not a higher kind than substance, because being is a relation.**
> Of course, someone might think that some kind stands above substance. But it is not clear what such a kind would be except being, or perhaps the even more general kind _thing;_ and as I have already said, not only does **Aristotle reject the idea that being is a genus**, but it is difficult to see what the relevant sense of _thing_ is, if this is not simply another word for _substance_.

#### Quantity

**Quantity as a highest kind is justified.**
> Like substance, quantity seems like a reasonable candidate for a highest kind — quantities exist; quantities are not substances; substances are not quantities, and it is not clear what kind would stand above quantity.

**The category of quantity is ambiguous.**
> Of course, there are quantities naturally associated with some of these species. For instance, length, breadth, and depth are associated with line, body, and surface. But Aristotle does not list these as the species under quantity. So, in the first instance, we can ask: does Aristotle intend his division of Quantity to be a division of quantities or quantified things?

**Some things appear to be both substances and quantities.**
> Aristotle’s list of species in the Category of Quantity is thus not merely puzzling but seems to commit Aristotle to a contradiction. So, a second question about Aristotle’s category of quantity naturally suggests itself: how can body be a species in both the category of quantity and the category of substance?

#### Relatives

**Relatives require extra completion in predicate structure.**
> Perhaps the most straightforward reading of Aristotle’s discussion is the following. He noticed that certain predicates in language are logically incomplete — they are not used in simple subject/predicate sentences of the form ‘_a_ is _F_’ but rather require some type of completion. To say ‘three is greater’ is to say something that is incomplete — to complete it requires saying what three is greater than.

**Relatives are about related things, rather than the relations themselves.**
> This latter fact, namely that in his discussion of relatives **Aristotle seems focused on related things rather than relation**s, places pressure on the easy characterization of the categories that I discussed previously, namely that each category is a distinct type of extra-linguistic entity. If that easy characterization were correct, Aristotle should have countenanced some type of entity corresponding to relatives as a highest kind. But he did not.

**Categories may characterize how different predicates apply to the world.**
> Hence, it is tempting to shift to an interpretation according to which **Aristotle is after all focused on linguistically characterized items**. And perhaps he thinks that the world contains just a few basic types of entity and that **different types of predicates apply to the world in virtue of complex semantic relations to just those types of entity**. As it turns out, many commentators have interpreted him in this way.
## Whence the categories?

**Metaphysical categories are based on linguistic structure.**
> According to the grammatical approach, which traces to Trendelenburg (1846) and has most recently been defended by Michael Baumer (1993), Aristotle generated his list by paying attention to the structures inherent in language. **On the assumption that the metaphysical structure of the world mirrors the structures in language, we should be able to find the basic metaphysical structures by examining our language**.

**Grammatical approach distinguishes primary substances.**
> The distinction between substance and the rest of the categories, for instance, is built into the subject-predicate structure of our language. Consider, for instance, the two sentences: (1) Socrates is a human; and (2) Socrates is white. First, we see that each sentence has a subject, namely ‘Socrates’. Corresponding to that subject, one might think, is an entity of some kind, namely a primary substance.

**Primary substances are different from secondary because they are individuated.**
> Moreover, the first sentence contains what might be called an individuating predicate — it is a predicate of the form, _a_ such and such, rather than of the form, such and such. So, one might think, there are predicates that attribute to primary substances properties the having of which suffices for that substance to be an individual of some kind. 

**Features (coincidental categories) are not individuated.**
> On the other hand, the second sentence contains a non-individuating predicate. So by examining the details of the predicates in our language, we have some grounds for distinguishing between the category of substance and the accidental categories.
