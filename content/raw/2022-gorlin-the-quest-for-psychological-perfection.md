##### Acknowledging the value of acceptanace therapies for irrational self-talk
>And I owe a great debt of gratitude to the various therapeutic approaches—most notably cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)—which have taught me to let go of that rigid, tyrannical mindset, replacing its constant criticism and negativity with kinder, more patient and constructive forms of self-talk.

##### Leaving behind perfectionism led to acceptance of subpar outcomes
>Did casting off perfectionism have to mean settling for these imperfections?
>
>According to the modern therapeutic approaches I was knee-deep in studying and practicing at the time, the answer seemed to be a resounding “yes.”

>In freeing me from the tyranny of perfectionism, the field had armed me with a fresh arsenal of rationalizations against the ambitious pursuit of excellence.

##### Psychology makes pursuing excellence problematic
>By equating the genuine quest for perfection with its fake, neurotic counterpart, the psychological establishment renders both pathological. Thus, in the name of preserving psychological wellbeing, it discourages the ambitious pursuit of excellence in _any_ domain of our lives—including, ironically, our own psychological wellbeing.
>
>In so doing, it cuts us off from pursuing the very ideals of personal excellence—ideals like action-orientation, self-honesty, and industriousness—that could deliver us from pathological perfectionism, among many other ills.

##### Defining perfection
>In championing the quest for self-perfection, I’m not talking about “perfection” as some arbitrary, impossible, nitpicky standard set by some arbitrary external authority. I’m talking about the broadly Aristotelian concept of perfection as “potential fully actualized”; as excellence in the exercise of one’s capacities and the realization of one’s carefully chosen ideals.

##### The role of radical acceptance
> Where I differ from mainstream conceptions of “acceptance” is that I regard it as part of a tight feedback loop with the quest for perfection: the goal is not merely to find peace with the way we are, but to build an ever healthier, wiser, more vital version of ourselves.

##### Contrasting mainstream approaches
> In contrast to each of these mainstream approaches, I conceive of human beings as fully capable of building, and re-building, themselves—motives, mindsets, emotions, action habits, and all. I do not think our ulterior motives are as invisible to us or as immune to our conscious volitional control as a psychodynamic therapist assumes; else I would not believe us capable of practicing and developing [self-trust](https://genagorlin.substack.com/p/vision-or-delusion-why-ambitious). Nor do I think we adopt our beliefs and thinking patterns from our social environment as mechanically as the CBT therapist assumes; else I would not believe we _needed_ to develop self-trust, in addition to whatever practical thinking and decision-making skills we might pursue. And nor do I think our abstract beliefs about ourselves and the world are either ultimately meaningless or unalterable, as the ACT therapist assumes; else I would not invest so much effort in [coaching people toward a builder’s perspective on themselves and the world](https://genagorlin.substack.com/p/how-to-coach-a-builder).
