# Highlights

## Affliction
- Affliction is not suffering, which can be borne. Affliction destroys something essential to the human person ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjstgdnmncz4gdp4q415dzdx))
- To say that the afflicted have had their human rights violated is an offensively inadequate description of what’s happened to them. They’ve had their humanity stripped ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjstj00d3qzww4n7wbv8jsbp))
- Slavery as practised by ancient Rome is only an extreme form of affliction. The men of antiquity, who knew all about this question, used to say: “A man loses half his soul the day he becomes a slave ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjt1njqj9va4tdeg5wgbqhy5))
- Legal rights are contentions of entitlement ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjt1m94ygdwds1mz6w488vay))
- The cry of the afflicted isn’t a demand for rights but a wounded howl. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjt1meftwbsceag64sq0q6dd))
- It is not surprising that the innocent are killed, tortured, driven from their country, made destitute, or reduced to slavery, imprisoned in camps and cells… But it is surprising that God should have given affliction the power to seize the very souls of the innocent and to take possession of them as their sovereign lord. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjt1q0rrfv55w6yfxwc9x993))
    - Note: How does she know this to be true, in a metaphysical sense? What evidence is there of affliction? What basis? Where does it *emerge* from?
- Affliction removes the disguise of reason and reveals the lowest and most animal parts of our nature, for both the afflicted and the unafflicted ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjt5z3dsdkkeb7d0meqwaye9))
    - Note: Affliction and multitasking...
      If addiction is affliction, then so too is my eating disorder?
- Not my will but thine be done’ is a recognition that no circumstance within this life could detract from the justice of divine will. An act of faith like this means that suffering, no matter how intolerable or unjust, will not lead to the affliction which separates a person from God. In this way a soul can be drawn out of affliction ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjt66742737ckmym227694gt))
- The saint kisses lepers ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjt682mze3adtn0j2826bwzs))

## Affliction II

- Let all men know that grace comes after tribulation. Let them know that without the burden of afflictions it is impossible to reach the height of grace. Let them know that the gifts of grace increase as the struggles increase ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hgbnezmwvc258kfbjc98xxqg))
- She could be accused, like St Rose of Lima or Lana del Rey, of romanticising suffering without really understanding the condition of someone trapped by it. But I think it’s more that Weil thought with her entire being. Her intellectual experiments required commiting her entire lifestyle to a proposition to explore whether there was any truth to it. Her thought was fundamentally experiential, governed above all by her encounters with supernatural grace ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hgbnneh8scs8ty15c6adjx52))
- But here is the dubious angel – hybrid of hubris and humility – who makes mistakes, for whom things go wrong, who constantly discovers its own faults and failings, yet who still persists in the pain of staking itself, with the courage to initiate action and the commitment to go on and on, learning from those mistakes and risking new ventures. The dubious angel constantly changes its self-identity and its relation to others. Yet it appears commonplace, pedestrian, bulky and grounded – even though, *mirabile dictu*, there are no grounds and no ground ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hgbnv1pg6gavx9byb8dhz0k6))
- Not everyone who follows the path to sanctity will make it; some, unable to fully place their lives in the hands of God, will be eaten up by their lower natures. If grace can’t save everyone, then coercion is necessary to prevent social and political disaster. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hgbny2vfd9h7qrnqgr319qvj))
- In the absence of any framework for talking about souls, salvation, the high drama of human life with its great risks and rewards, inner lives and relationships are kept within a safe middle zone, the bounds of which are policed zealously ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hgbp04nbaem3t2nhyr157rnq))
- The only ethical life risks living unethically. It accepts the risk that the very faculties that allow moral and rational life may be corrupted. The Christian entering the gladatorial arena could, at the last moment, be consumed by the terror of death and lash out in wild panic, killing her persecutors. It’s only by risking this possibility and enduring in faith until the end that she becomes a martyr. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hgbp190sc4bm2f0xg2sc2whw))
- However, I’ve also gained more respect for ‘civilisation’ as a concept—as in, the edifice built up around human nature that moulds it into something capable of higher things like morality and rationality ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjt9vzdc3sxq94503hm2fcxv))
    - Note: Aristotle: the role of politics (social scaffolding) is to create the conditions for the contemplative life
