# What is complexity?
## Introduction to the study of complexity
- Each neuron is relatively simple compared to the whole brain, and again there's no central control. Somehow, the huge ensemble of neurons and connections give rise to the complex behaviors that we call cognition, intelligence, or even creativity.
- A major focus of complex systems research is to understand how individually simple agents produce complex behavior without central control.
- In addition, the population of immune cells in the body is able to change, or adapt itself in response to what that population of cells perceives in its environment. This kind of adapatation is another key characteristic of complex systems.
- In complex systems terms, you could think of the genes as simple components that interact with other genes in a decentralized way. And the way that they interact is through genetic regulatory networks. They control one another's expression, where expression means translation into proteins.
- Complex systems scientists are very interested in studying large social networks such as Facebook, to understand their structure, how they form, how they change over time, and perhaps most interestingly, how information is transmitted in such networks, among other questions.

## Properties common to complex systems
- Complex systems are composed of simple components, often called agents. That is, they're simple, relative to the system as a whole.
- Another common property is that the components of the system interact in nonlinear ways. … But very informally, it means that the components interact in such a way that you can't just sum up all their activities and thereby derive what the whole system is doing. Colloquially, we might say that the whole is more than the sum of the parts.
- The components were not controlled by any central executive. … Instead, what we saw is that the system was able to organize itself in a decentralized way.
- The term "emergent" here refers to properties of the system that can't be easily understood from individual components, or small groups of individual components; but rather are collective outcomes of the whole system, and have to be understood at the system level rather than at the individual level.

## Definitions of complexity

- Seth Lloyd's paper called "Measures of Complexity: A Nonexhaustive List" gives something like 42 different definitions or ways of measuring complexity, including Shannon information, algorithmic complexity, fractal dimension, thermodynamic depth, etc., etc.
- I want to mention the ideas about complexity in one excellent, classic, and very prescient paper, called Science and Complexity, written by the American mathematician Warren Weaver in 1948.
- Weaver divided the problems of interest in science into three categories. The first category he called Problems of Simplicity. These are problems that involve just a few variables. … These are all problems that were dealt with in the 19th and early 20th centuries, in physics, chemistry, biology, and so on.
- Problems of Disorganized Complexity. … These are problems involving billions or trillions of variables.
- So one example would be understanding the laws of temperature and pressure, as arising from trillions of disorganized air molecules in a room or in the atmosphere. These are understood through taking averages over the large set of variables.
- The key here is that we're assuming very little interaction among the variables. That's what allows us to take meaningful averages.
- Weaver's last category was the problems of organized complexity. … key here is that, due to their strong nonlinear interactions, the variables cannot be meaningfully averaged.
- Weaver characterized these as "problems which involve dealing simultaneously with a sizable number of factors which are interrelated into an organic whole". … This "organic whole" refers to the emergent behavior of the system.

## Definitions of complexity: researchers answer
- David Krauker
	- Systems that don’t yield to compact forms of representation or description.
	- When it comes to the genome, or the brain, or properties of society or literary history, as far as we know, there are no such beautiful, elegant, compact descriptions. And that, for me, is evidence that we’re dealing with a complex system.
	- One of the characteristics, for me, of a complex system, is that it has found a means, or a mechanism, for extracting from its environment some information, in order to use it to behave adaptively, to predict and control.
- Cris Moore
	- In theoretical computer science, we don’t say that systems are complex or simple, per se, we more typically say that questions are complex if those questions require a lot of computational resources to solve. A lot of time, a lot of memory, a lot of communication between people. Some limited resource.
- Jim Crutchfield
	- It has a very sophisticated internal causal architecture that stores and processes information.
	- Shannon’s original notion of information as degree of surprise, degree of unpredictability in a system, or how random a system is needs to be augmented. So that’s certainly the focus of a lot of my work is trying to delineate that there are many different kinds of information, not just Shannonian information.
- John Rundle
	- A system that has interactions. It has nonlinear elements in it.
	- Most of the time, the interesting features in these systems have scaling properties, that is to say they have power laws or fractal objects in them, embedded in them someplace, either in the actual physical arrangement of them or in terms of the statistics that you see.
- Scott Page
	- A complex system consists of a bunch of entities that may not start out diverse, but end up being diverse.
	- In addition to be sort of diverse and interconnected, they are also interdependent, so the actions of one agent in the system will sort of influence or have implications for another agent.
	- The agents adapt and respond to the environment which that they’re in.
	- Now this last part gets a little bit tricky philosophically, because adaptation is really just a higher-order rule, so you can have a first-level rule and then a meta rule and so, you could say that they are rule based, but they are sort of meta rule based, that they allow for behavior that can respond to the signals that they are getting both globally and locally.
	- A system like that can be complex, but it need not be. So a system can have those components to it, but it can end up producing an equilibrium.
- Stephanie Forrest
	- All of the components are either learning or modifying their behavior in some way while the system is behaving.
- Geoffrey West
	- I think a critical part of a complex system that distinguishes it from what we might call a simple system, like the motion of the planets around the sun, is that on the one hand, you can't encapsulate the dynamics in just a few simple equations and that is intimately related to the fact that these systems are evolving and are adaptable. And I think that this is one of the most crucial differences between that and traditional systems that I have dealt with in most of my career under the guise of physics.
