# Highlights
- existentialism, in our sense of the word, is a doctrine that does render human life possible; a doctrine, also, which affirms that every truth and every action imply both an environment and a human subjectivity ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hp7gmbzs7arm7qrp8a2q2s4n))
- For at bottom, what is alarming in the doctrine that I am about to try to explain to you is – is it not? – that it confronts man with a possibility of choice. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hp8z6jvt4p2tghs67x26ffy0))
- For in truth this is of all teachings the least scandalous and the most austere: it is intended strictly for technicians and philosophers. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hp7gp9996qzvd0tr3cqsv1xa))
    - Note: Then what is the end?
- *existence* comes before *essence* – or, if you will, that we must begin from the subjective ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hp9btn5rzvpc3avbbde762mf))
- each man is a particular example of a universal conception, the conception of Man. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hp9bxgpenq5wtz7ft6hczvyf))
    - Note: The Platonic view; how is Sartre's formulation unique?
- What do we mean by saying that existence precedes essence? We mean that man first of all exists, encounters himself, surges up in the world – and defines himself afterwards ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hp9c123brqdmh5rq4vy2kzdg))
- Thus, there is no human nature, because there is no God to have a conception of it. Man simply is. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hp9c1cggq9xbrhnm0f1mhdnn))
    - Note: When does the "man" begin? With the individual? Still seems to be appealing to a collective consciousness
- Man is nothing else but that which he makes of himself. That is the first principle of existentialism. And this is what people call its “subjectivity,” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hp9c0rq79w41axbkkdh9cw2r))
- the first effect of existentialism is that it puts every man in possession of himself as he is, and places the entire responsibility for his existence squarely upon his own shoulders ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hp9c65wgsa860m0cms70w6pd))
- when we say that man is responsible for himself, we do not mean that he is responsible only for his own individuality, but that he is responsible for all men ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hp9c6df038vzvgyhycksj5n1))
    - Note: What?
- Subjectivism means, on the one hand, the freedom of the individual subject and, on the other, that man cannot pass beyond human subjectivity. It is the latter which is the deeper meaning of existentialism. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hp9c7fkw54tspycnstwgfd9v))
    - Note: The next few sentences are not convincing me.
- I am thus responsible for myself and for all men, and I am creating a certain image of man as I would have him to be. In fashioning myself I fashion man ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hp9cgdxzpprr77tt9zq339cb))
    - Note: How can any be consequential if they are all different? And if they are the same, is it not because they are a part of a so-called complex system? Isn't there something deterministic about people only choosing from a fixed menu of options, despite their freedom? What is society if not made up of simpler agents?
- When a man commits himself to anything, fully realising that he is not only choosing what he will be, but is thereby at the same time a legislator deciding for the whole of mankind – in such a moment a man cannot escape from the sense of complete and profound responsibility. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hp9cqjew35d2dxnbf31t3a9p))
    - Note: Anguish; those who do not feel the anxiety are lying to themselves.
      I do not understand the Abraham reference at all—oh, saying that I am the one who creates meaning and belief, follows from my existence?
- Far from being a screen which could separate us from action, it is a condition of action itself. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hp9cymp5e5603c5zf0nfaf3a))
    - Note: Anguish is not quietism.
- And when we speak of “abandonment” – a favorite word of Heidegger – we only mean to say that God does not exist, and that it is necessary to draw the consequences of his absence right to the end ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpbwaqaptvn9fm64ffkj2js6))
    - Note: "With abandonment goes anguish"; wait, does the experience of anguish arrive or leave the person lol
- The existentialist, on the contrary, finds it extremely embarrassing that God does not exist, for there disappears with Him all possibility of finding values in an intelligible heaven ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hp9d1hqvv0pzx47qhcb2tf8e))
- There can no longer be any good *a priori*, since there is no infinite and perfect consciousness to think it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hp9d2ghrj3s78rptyc7dwvw6))
    - Note: "Abandonment"
- we are now upon the plane where there are only men. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hp9d2mnfpv2qzsm6rgj5p77b))
- there is no determinism – man is free, man *is* freedom ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hp9d4g77vnmbgmjpwfdeamvk))
    - Note: The third path of chaos, randomness.
- He thinks that man is responsible for his passion ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpbjhx9be7ka1zr5891mmenn))
    - Note: That is, the existentialist.
- In other words, feeling is formed by the deeds that one does; therefore I cannot consult it as a guide to action. And that is to say that I can neither seek within myself for an authentic impulse to action, nor can I expect, from some ethic, formulae that will enable me to act. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpbwcw795yt927pzbhqs57k8))
    - Note: Then is action spontaneous, created from nothing? How is this possible? The student needs a war to fight in, one acts as a loyal soldier or a son, participating in the essence of Solider or Son...
- As for “despair,” the meaning of this expression is extremely simple. It merely means that we limit ourselves to a reliance upon that which is within our wills, or within the sum of the probabilities which render our action feasible. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpbws6z2wcb0fx6s4xp6mhep))
    - Note: Only concern yourself with anything that has no degree of separation.
- When Descartes said, “Conquer yourself rather than the world,” what he meant was, at bottom, the same – that we should act without hope. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpbwst410pefqyegtspk58dv))
    - Note: "Despair".
- I ought to commit myself and then act my commitment, according to the time-honoured formula that “one need not hope in order to undertake one’s work.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpbwxmry7a4sdyj8dzeg5fxc))
    - Note: Lol, Sartre's meaning of living with despair.
- Quietism is the attitude of people who say, “let others do what I cannot do.” The doctrine I am presenting before you is precisely the opposite of this, since it declares that there is no reality except in action. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpbwzewt414z882eyyb7ccr2))
    - Note: Existentialism is the opposite of quietism, inaction.
- So there remains within me a wide range of abilities, inclinations and potentialities, unused but perfectly viable, which endow me with a worthiness that could never be inferred from the mere history of my actions.” But in reality and for the existentialist, there is no love apart from the deeds of love; no potentiality of love other than that which is manifested in loving; there is no genius other than that which is expressed in works of art. The genius of Proust is the totality of the works of Proust ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpby9nybqfkak4rndewean93))
    - Note: Ouch. Maybe I need to internalize this.
- What we mean to say is that a man is no other than a series of undertakings, that he is the sum, the organisation, the set of relations that constitute these undertakings. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpby8nwxrtnenz6v66aw1941))
- There is no such thing as a cowardly temperament. There are nervous temperaments; there is what is called impoverished blood, and there are also rich temperaments. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpbycdf9w6b3kh26gca6qg5w))
    - Note: What's the difference? Why isn't the latter determinism lol?
- this theory alone is compatible with the dignity of man, it is the only one which does not make man into an object ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpbyhdwt9qvdjtr22zhx7yht))
    - Note: And why should this not be true? Doesn't man's uniqueness still mean participation in some kind of Man form?
- Contrary to the philosophy of Descartes, contrary to that of Kant, when we say “I think” we are attaining to ourselves in the presence of the other, and we are just as certain of the other as we are of ourselves. Thus the man who discovers himself directly in the *cogito* also discovers all the others, and discovers them as the condition of his own existence. He recognises that he cannot be anything (in the sense in which one says one is spiritual, or that one is wicked or jealous) unless others recognise him as such ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpbyp2y8x0wvxjk4asfm71wp))
- I cannot obtain any truth whatsoever about myself, except through the mediation of another. The other is indispensable to my existence, and equally so to any knowledge I can have of myself. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpbyqf95kevqk8fba6hv2297))
    - Note: What?
- every human purpose presents itself as an attempt either to surpass these limitations, or to widen them, or else to deny or to accommodate oneself to them. Consequently every purpose, however individual it may be, is of universal value. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpfjghg7rk7zjz326t1p9epd))
- In this sense we may say that there is a human universality, but it is not something given; it is being perpetually made ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpfjhb3f9hmynqz0e9dn654m))
- There is no difference between free being – being as self-committal, as existence choosing its essence – and absolute being. And there is no difference whatever between being as an absolute, temporarily localised that is, localised in history – and universally intelligible being. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpbyy4tdcpcjmedyhe21vzpt))
- man finds himself in an organised situation in which he is himself involved: his choice involves mankind in its entirety, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpbzaasxvbgrkm4kty43ab0q))
    - Note: Still don't understand why all humanity is involved. Because the choice is not based on particulars, circumstances?
- any man who takes refuge behind the excuse of his passions, or by inventing some deterministic doctrine, is a self-deceiver. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpfjwnzsmcrnzdqzw2vb0jmd))
- I cannot make liberty my aim unless I make that of others equally my aim ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpfjvb4mqb5x7akqn6g5zc9g))
- Life is nothing until it is lived; but it is yours to make sense of, and the value of it is nothing else but the sense that you choose. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpfk1k6n9sy2zfj5kkr3j1a7))
- Man is all the time outside of himself: it is in projecting and losing himself beyond himself that he makes man to exist; and, on the other hand, it is by pursuing transcendent aims that he himself is able to exist. Since man is thus self-surpassing, and can grasp objects only in relation to his self-surpassing, he is himself the heart and center of his transcendence. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpfk43e5e5c6pddrkv9thk5h))
    - Note: Defining humanism.
