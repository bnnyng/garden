# Abstract

> The last ten years have seen an increasing interest, within cognitive science, in issues concerning the physical body, the local environment, and the complex interplay between neural systems and the wider world in which they function. Yet many unanswered questions remain, and the shape of a genuinely **physically embodied**, **environmentally embedded** science of the mind is still unclear. In this article I will raise a number of critical questions concerning the nature and scope of this approach, drawing a distinction between **two kinds of appeal to embodiment**: (1) ‘**Simple**’ cases, in which bodily and environmental properties merely constrain accounts that retain the focus on inner organization and processing; and (2) More **radical** appeals, in which attention to bodily and environmental features is meant to transform both the subject matter and the theoretical framework of cognitive science.

# Highlights

## Embodied behavior

> The roboticist Rodney Brooks has coined the slogan ‘The world is its own best model’.

> Behavioral success involves locking on to simple (but often far from obvious) properties of the environment made available in the perceptual array.

## Embodiment and computation

> In the traditional model, the brain takes in data, performs a complex computation that solves the problem (where will the ball land?) and then instructs the body where to go. This is a linear processing cycle: perceive, compute and act. 

> In the second model, the problem is not solved ahead of time. Instead, the task is to maintain, by multiple, real-time adjustments to the run, a kind of co-ordination between the inner and the outer worlds.

> Such co-ordination dynamics constitute something of a challenge to traditional ideas about perception and action: they replace the notion of rich internal representations and computations, with the notion of less expensive strategies whose task is not first to represent the world and then reason on the basis of the representation, but instead to maintain a kind of adaptively potent equilibrium that couples the agent and the world together.

## Cognition and adaptive coupling

> One reason for thinking \[that adaptive coupling is not cognition] is that cognition has been taken to involve the capacity to relate to an ‘intentional object’42 – and this means, in part, an object that might not be present-at-hand or that might not even exist.

> The mark of the cognitive, then, is the capacity to engage in something like off-line reason43 – reasoning in the absence of that which our thoughts concern. Classical (‘disembodied’) cognitive science accounted well for this, by positing an inner realm richly populated with internal tokens that stood for external objects and states of affairs.

> One promising advance is the suggestion that embodied cognitive science might treat off-line reason as something like simulated sensing and acting, thus preserving the special flavor of embodied problem-solving alongside a high degree of ability to decouple from the environment.

## Simple and radical embodiment

> These accounts of radical embodiment all involve one or more of the following claims: 
> (I) that understanding the complex interplay of brain, body and world requires new analytic tools and methods, such as those of dynamical systems theory; 
> (II) that traditional notions of internal representation and computation are inadequate and unnecessary;
> (III) that the typical decomposition of the cognitive system into a variety of inner neural or functional subsystems is often misleading, and blinds us to the possibility of alternative, and more explanatory, decompositions that cut across the traditional brain–body–world divisions.

> Closely related to these three points is the idea that even the subject matter of cognitive science needs to be re-thought. A mature science of the mind, it now seems, targets not (or not only) the individual, inner organization of intelligence but the bodily and environmentally extended organizations responsible for adaptive success.

## Radical embodiment and advanced cognition

> In thinking about ‘higher’ cognition and advanced human reason, it might likewise prove fruitful to consider the literal extension of the cognitive system to include aspects of the local environment.

> The external environment, actively structured by us, becomes a source of cognition-enhancing ‘wideware’ – external items (devices, media, notations) that scaffold and complement (but usually do not replicate) biological modes of computation and processing, creating extended cognitive systems whose computational profiles are quite different from those of the isolated brain.

> Human brains, raised in this sea of cultural tools, might develop strategies for advanced problem solving that ‘factor in’ these external resources as profoundly and deeply as the bodily motions of the tuna factor in and maximally exploit the reliable properties of the surrounding water.
