## The future of fiction

### Paul Dalla Rosa

> Everyone has ADHD and no one reads.

> The future of fiction will not be mainstream, nor will it be in any institution. At times, their paths will cross but in dissemination more and more writers will take a path closer to a creator model, or perhaps they will work alone and in obscurity, like Henry Darger, except every now and then they’ll upload PDFs. These will either be read by thousands or no one. **Audiences will be smaller and cultivated and occasionally composed solely of language learning models.**

> Already we’ve seen changes in consciousness due to mass media. These have been accelerated by the Internet, changes in personality, thought, psychopathologies and neuroses brought about by the advent and then changes in the architecture of the web, 1.0 to 2.0, the appearance of the smartphone, access to the means for each of us to not only receive information but transmit it as well.

### Daisy Alioto

> I have been thinking lately about the atomic unit of “content,” content being a dirty word, of course, … When I say [[Atomic unit|atomic unit]] I mean the smallest thing you can be and still be that thing. So for content, that might be a single sentence or word or letter or asemic scribble or hand on the cave wall but not in this economy! 

> Recent history has shown that the atomic unit of content is the minimum viable precursor to adaptability.

> Nonetheless, surveying the current technology landscape where venture capitalists tout artificial intelligences that can generate words and images prompted at the speed of thought, we are forced to conclude that the atomic unit of content is not the novella, or Big Plot (The Corrections, The Overstory), or celebrity reputation (Reese, Oprah) or a single BookTok or even a vibe (autofiction). **The atomic unit of content is, and always has been, an idea and most ideas are bad.**

> As it turns out, the faster we speedrun the cycle from tweet to essay to book to film to bucket hat the more we circle back on the “idea” as the smallest valuable thing. And idea-maxxing in turn ushers us toward quietness, a state which technology is famously bad at maintaining.
