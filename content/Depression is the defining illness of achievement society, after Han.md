Depression in Han’s “achievement society” comes has the following sources:
- Lack of attachment to anything in an increasingly atomized society;
- Exhaustion at excess positivity;
- Inability to continue achieving.

Such circumstances lead depressed individuals to “destructive self-reproach and auto-aggression” [[@2015han]].
