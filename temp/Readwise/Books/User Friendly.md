- Years later, Steve Jobs would describe a computer as a bicycle for the mind—a fabulous machine that could turn the muscle power of a single person into the ability to traverse a mountain in a day. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hp0ea9jg3qvexbg8t9qvpfmz))

- When something works well enough for you to predict what it’ll do next, you eventually form a *mental model* of it. That mental model can be deep or shallow—it might vary from just a sense that this button does that, to a picture in your head about how your hybrid car charges its battery. But those mental models are knowingly crafted by the designers who put interfaces in front of you. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hp51tqm7k2a6they9qm1j4yr))
- For you to master how a machine works, it needs to adhere to a pattern language. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hp51tw6zr1t1rhk7m16fz8mt))
    - Note: Connection to Alexander book!
- Feedback is the keystone of the user-friendly world. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hp51t1cn0mepev7tkpsxh2bm))
- Is there any problem in which our behavior doesn’t match how we’d like to live that isn’t a feedback problem? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hp520zjvge7tm0wbabtncbxd))
    - Note: User friendliness is an embodiment problem
- Mental models are nothing more and nothing less than the intuitions we have about how something works—how its pieces and functions fit together. They’re based on the things we’ve used before; you might describe the entire task of user experience as the challenge of fitting a new product to our mental models of how things *should* work.

- Design is nothing more—and nothing less—than creating artifacts imbued with such shared understanding, legible to their users. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hp52cp9smshg9n0at68wst5n))
- But there is a broad trend in our culture driving the most specialized things to become easier to use. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hp52fp1tfgxv2e553shaj16f))
