# Highlights
- the history of *systems of thought* and concomitant media of expression through which ideas have been organised ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzr4t1jnmttghcd66p06gywn))
    - Note: Useful context for Ong's thought.
- empire of print, which was the unchallenged medium of communication for all of the great realist knowledge systems of modernity – science (the paper), journalism (the press) and imaginative fiction (the novel). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzr4wjr4hhjdnzykkzx0p5mn))
    - Note: "Tripartite division of the real."
- who tried to classify knowledge on the basis of the relationship between forms of communication and human faculties. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzr4z4jsdtsjxtwsqwse2s4e))
- “poesy, aligned with the imagination, held a pivotal place in Bacon’s scheme to advance learning; by linking reason with the will and appetite” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzr4ytdw0nrcn6rr1tf5rxtg))
- Later specialisation forced “science” and “fiction” ever further apart, at least in principle, but Bacon wanted to broker a “symbiotic relationship between scientific understanding and affective poetics” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzr50rdb5ebagsq67cyzh8r1))
- pre-modern arts of knowledge – logic, rhetoric, and dialectics ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzrg7tfht9e3hyp1v3zdfqz4))
    - Note: How are these arts of KNOWLEDGE? Major social component.
- knowledge is a product of language, and that the medium in which language is communicated – by voice, writing, print – makes us think along certain path-dependent lines. Ong went further: he contended that “writing *restructures consciousness* ” ( *Orality and Literacy:* Chapter 4). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzrg9j8nachjtrejaf7r0176))
    - Note: "The medium is the message" vs. Ongism, where mind is determined by medium.
- linguistic analysis ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzrgbh14dapxyej8gpqt432e))
    - Note: Connecting rhetoric with science, which is the same as knowledge—why?

- *Americanists* sought the intellectual origins of US superiority in what Ong’s own academic mentor, Perry Miller (1939; 1953), called “the New England Mind” – a Protestant, “downright,” democratic, “plainstyle” mind. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzs4knsrh8m972j2je0yj4qb))

- The presumption is that the “American mind, although a many-faceted thing” (Ong 2002: 294) can be equated with the human mind. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j031s2ghh35cc0b794ynfxa0))
- “Freedom” – the “American way” – was built on the capability of *winning an argument*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0330xa57zg25g2c9w3jhavs))
- science of noetics, then, of “knowing how we know ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0330f2kzrtdmghjvdfg722g))
- At the micro level, the individual citizen needed mental software to engage in an increasingly textualised world; one where knowing relied on technologically transported information that was abstracted from its contextual roots, just as writing and print are abstracted from the situated immediacy of speech. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0333bdw7hxerr3qksqrz5bf))
- *everyone* must exercise the “soft power” of knowledge. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0333fysc1d8nk0amd6cfmq5))
