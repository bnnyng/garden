- Thank God I do not suffer from any *a priori* antisemitism, but what I know from experience of the qualities and faults of the Jewish temperament does not fit in any too well with my own and is particularly ill-adapted to the demands of everyday life together. There is an equally wide divergence between my instinctive reactions and those of a militant supporter of the extreme left. Moreover I am a little suspicious of graduates in philosophy, and as for intellectuals who want to return to the land, I am well enough acquainted with them to know that, with a few rare exceptions, they belong to that order of cranks whose undertakings generally come to a bad end.

    - Note: This is hilarious. Entire introduction is how I hope someone will write about me someday.
- She actually experienced in its heart-breaking reality the distance between ‘knowing’ and ‘knowing with all one’s soul’, and the one object of her life was to abolish that distance ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hp0qe5qvs443s16geq18qpkw))
- The effort of expression’, she wrote to me, ‘has a bearing not only on the form but on the thought and on the whole inner being. So long as bare simplicity of expression is not attained, the thought has not touched or even come near to true greatness ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hp0qm4p26k6fzaew7dc3kba8))
- The real way of writing is to write as we translate. When we translate a text written in some foreign language, we do not seek to add anything to it; on the contrary, we are scrupulously careful not to add anything to it. That is how we have to try to translate a text which is not written down.’ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hp0qmc8ddz4vtdtqdx9m7hj1))
- I am not a person with whom it is advisable to link one’s fate. Human beings have always more or less sensed this; but, I do not know for what mysterious reason, ideas seem to have less discernment. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hp0rg9vbqxnkgywncs29kb8g))
- Luckily, however, what is within me is either valueless or else it exists outside me in a perfect form, in a place of purity where no harm can come to it and whence it will always be able to come down again ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hp0rjgc8tne4ahd5877pzxew))
    - Note: Platonic, no one instantiation of an idea is it's whole form.
- To say that the world is not worth anything, that this life is of no value, and to give evil as the proof is absurd, for if these things are worthless what does evil take from us?’ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hp0s4yba64j0nh08ma5533d3))
- Gravity is the force which above all others draws us from God. It impels each creature to seek everything which can preserve or enlarge it and, as Thucydides says, to exercise all the power of which it is capable. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hp0sar6gfrfaztwgmaw4cedq))
- Simone Weil presents the problem of evil as follows: ‘How can we escape from that which corresponds to gravity in ourselves?’ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hp0safe579y2m44qvgtttwdk))
- God consented through love to cease to be everything so that we might be something; we must consent through love to cease to be anything so that God may become everything again. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hp0scdt42bpwzngrvyq6dk4s))
- Therein lies the tragedy of degradation. It is irreparable, not because the self which it destroys is precious, for the self is made to be destroyed, but because it prevents God from effecting the destruction himself and robs eternalizing love of its prey.

- It is easy to die for something forceful because participation in force produces an intoxication which stupefies us. But it is supernatural to die for something weak: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hp0shw5snk7fa99ctkx4zte6))

- Or again, we find the law of the insertion of the higher into the lower formulated thus: ‘Every order which transcends another can only be introduced into it under the form of something infinitely small. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq0467jsdmqq4a9h5gx01n1g))
    - Note: Such an interesting inversion of how I pictured the more abstract—an overarching umbrella.
