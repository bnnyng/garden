# Highlights
- This is where all the details of a horseâ€™s last 12 races are listed and it is the section most used by handicappers when comparing one horse to another ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hc9p4d5713et927n6s19rbfr))
- Always check the date of the last race. Horses coming off long layoffs must be proven off such layoffs, or their trainers must be proven winners with horses coming off a layoff. Also note that horses that have run well off a layoff in the past often continue to do so throughout their careers. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hc9p6fe02ng8jcbxrm9pwxxg))
- Fractional times are used in conjunction with beaten lengths when performing advanced pace handicapping. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hc9p812d3t1bba3jrqvvwrax))
- Post positions are important when used in conjunction with distance and the makeup of the racetrack. At some tracks outside post positions are disadvantageous going certain distances. At other tracks, inside posts are disadvantageous going certain distances. It pays to know which posts the highest and lowest percentage of winners come from at different distances for each track. Post position win percentages are usually listed in the racing form for each track. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hc9pe66c5y5z20krrafj6n7f))
- In very general terms, horses with a high percentage of 1s and 2s in their running lines like to race near the front. Horses with a preponderance of 5s and higher in their running lines usually like to race from well off the pace. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hc9pg24w4mn5nrg360j3zr9k))
- Good handicappers can always predict how a race will setup using the running lines. In a matter of seconds they can determine if there is a lone speed horse or multiple speed horses, which horses come from just off the pace and which are stalkers that come from well back.

- An additional handicapping angle overlooked by many bettors can be found when the winner of a race or even the first two finishers in a race finish a large number of lengths in front of the remainder of a field. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hc9pvxb868p54yynqar8tqdz))
