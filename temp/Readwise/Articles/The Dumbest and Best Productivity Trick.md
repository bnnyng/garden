- I try to keep home very pretty,” Angelou said in 1975, “and I can’t work in a pretty surrounding. It throws me.” She described her routine in a 1983 interview:

I keep a dictionary, a Bible, a deck of cards and a bottle of sherry in the room. I try to get there around 7, and I work until 2 in the afternoon. If the work is going badly, I stay until 12:30.
