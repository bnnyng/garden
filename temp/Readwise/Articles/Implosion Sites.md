# Highlights
- It would seem like those archivists had suddenly decided to destroy the concept they loved by turning it into a banal abstraction, an averaged-out set of visual indicators rather than a kaleidoscope of perceptions on an inexhaustible subject of inspiration. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz9q5s6da8azpnjxb8wy1ays))
- Data is no longer about the world but is instead taken to be the world itself, as though materiality were a matter not of atoms but of information. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz9q4srf14fma1tse2qd6hgw))
- But measurement is an act of power, not observation. Datafication always reifies an existing distribution of power that grants the measurers the ability to decide which aspects of the world count and which ones donâ€™t. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz9q8vw31mws4etx9rq0907m))

- an archive recognizes the power relations intrinsic to measurement (and representation in general) whereas a dataset suppresses them (helping entrench the power relations that underwrite the data it assembles). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz9qav8xpevv108psk8xrv0g))
- Google is using generative models to replace the pseudo-marketplace-of-ideas offered by search results with something more overtly authoritarian. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz9qcyc0dycfbbjnsv87wdf4))
    - Note: Oh, this is why I feel so uncomfortable about it!
