# Highlights
- As much as people are precious about their craft and the idea that all of their output be credited to their own innate genius, you will never make something in your life that does not have the touch of another artist on it. That’s how it works. It’s spectacularly beautiful. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hshk139gw2kggp97nxh1m5nx))
    - Note: I am not sure I agree as much with the rest of Eliza's writing as I do with Schopenhauer. How does one privilege expression over consideration of others, valuation of their time? Also thinking of Franklin's virtue of chastity a bit: "Rarely use venery but for health or offspring, never to dullness, weakness, or the injury of your own or another’s peace or reputation." Could say something similar for spiritual health and production.
- You think your pain and your heartbreak are unprecedented in the history of the world, but then you read. It was Dostoevsky and Dickens who taught me that the things that tormented me most were the very things that connected me with all the people who were alive, or who ever had been alive. Only if we face these open wounds in ourselves can we understand them in other people. An artist is a sort of emotional or spiritual historian.
