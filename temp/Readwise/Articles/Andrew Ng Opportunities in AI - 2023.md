# Highlights
- But with the rise of iOS, with the rise of iPhone, someone also figured out how to build things like Uber, and Airbnb, and Tinder. The very long term, very defensible businesses that created sustaining value. And I think, with the rise of generative AI or the rise of new AI tools, I think, really,
  what excites me is the opportunity to create those really deep, really hard applications that hopefully can create very long term value. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbhz4pn7xk7yfcsrc04y9fr6))
- So I think of this as-- this is what I think of as an AI stack. At the bottom level is the hardware, semiconductor layer. Fantastic opportunities there, but very capital intensive, very concentrated. So needs a lot of resources, relatively few winners.

- There's also the infrastructure layer. Also fantastic opportunities, but very capital intensive, very concentrated. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbj08ab99e3tj2gykk42jx7j))
- And then lastly, even though a lot of the media attention and the buzz is in the infrastructure and developer tooling layer, it turns out that layer can be successful only if the application layer is even more successful.

- And so at the application layer, I'm seeing a lot of exciting opportunities that seem to have a very large market, but where the competition sets is very light, relative to the magnitude of the opportunity. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbj0avy789tcd6mn7h7ys4e9))
- And if it passes this stage, then we will go and recruit a CEO to work with us on the project. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbj0cp42wzqr2wkp9cfsz4v4))
- And so I've learned that if I can just help get a accurate technical validation, and then use AI resources to make sure the AI tech is built quickly and well, and I think, we've always managed to help the companies build a strong technical team, then partnering with subject matter experts often results
  in exciting new opportunities. And ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbj0g6xt9wa1p4stgxje7bgy))
