# Highlights
- It was fine, it was money. I was paying rent, I was alive. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2dqbh765bz1hqc46ckzkanp))
- I could pretend I was a normal person. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2dqcnrnbvvyqwd2me38hjxq))
- Waitressing funded my rent and bills and food and clothes so I could spend the time that was leftover figuring out how to be a writer. I look at all the waiters and waitresses I knew over the years, and you can replace writer with anything. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2dqnte8pp1x41bm9wdgchd8))
- It has not made me a better writer. It’s made me lazy. It’s made me love money. It’s made me see that life is more than writing, it’s lessened my chokehold on dedication. I no longer identify as an ambitious person. I identify as a person who wants to make the life that they can scrape together as comfortable as possible.

- I suspect it’s easier to teach a waitress to be a writer than an intellectual to be a waiter. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2dqsxgxjze2nb1eh8tp6qbt))
- Everything is so much simpler than I imagined it was. I thought I was doing an easy job, but everything is an easy job when you know the system. Other professions weren’t magic. They were systems too. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h2e5tsmgszfnpm53q50wfbjt))
