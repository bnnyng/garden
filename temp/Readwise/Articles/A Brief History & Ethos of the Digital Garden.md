# Highlights
- A garden is a collection of evolving ideas that aren't strictly organised by their publication date. They're inherently exploratory â€“ notes are linked through contextual associations. They aren't refined or complete - notes are published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time. They're less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal websites we're used to seeing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hj00d0yctf3j7y4h8n4r0x3n))
