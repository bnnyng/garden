# Highlights
- Each transaction consists of a buyer exchanging money or credit with a seller for goods, services or financial assets. Credit spends just like money, so adding together the money spent and the amount of credit spent, you can know the total spending. The total amount of spending drives the economy. If you divide the amount spent by the quantity sold, you get the price. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbqs9aydz0ctgds3waz773v0))
    - Note: What a transaction is—building block of the "economic machine."
- economy. A market consists of all the buyers and all the sellers making transactions for the same thing. For example, there is a wheat market, a car market, a stock market and markets for millions of things.
  An economy consists of all of the transactions in all of its markets ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbqsb8kyye0deb39d0smj4ke))
- Borrowers promise to repay the amount they borrow, called the principal, plus an additional amount, called interest. When interest rates are high, there is less borrowing because it's expensive. When interest rates are low, borrowing increases because it's cheaper. When borrowers promise to repay and lenders believe them, credit is created. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbqsd4sp4bk027eaww3fefy3))
- names. As soon as credit is created, it immediately turns into debt. Debt is both an asset to the lender, and a liability to the borrower. In the future, when the borrower repays the loan, plus interest, the asset and liability disappear and the transaction is settled. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbqsdt5qh5wfvxye813txx11))
- So increased income allows increased borrowing which allows increased spending. And since one person's spending is another person's income, this leads to more increased borrowing and so on. This self-reinforcing pattern leads to economic growth and is why we have Cycles ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbqsfmekz5ans96x1edn3yk3))
- Productivity matters most in the long run, but credit matters most in the short run. This is because productivity growth doesn't fluctuate much, so it's not a big driver of economic swings.
  Debt is — because it allows us to consume more than we produce when we acquire it and it forces us to consume less than we produce when we pay it back ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbqsgm5fb5c7ebh6n3j2666y))
- Debt swings occur in two big cycles. One takes about 5 to 8 years and the other takes about 75 to 100 years. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbqshk10ceescb6fp7fy1zvf))
- As mentioned, swings around the line are not due to how much innovation or hard work there is, they're primarily due to how much credit there is ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbqshzzn44jj1hz3rzdfxv00))
- When you buy a beer from a bartender with cash, the transaction is settled immediately. But when you buy a beer with credit, it's like starting a bar tab. You're saying you promise to pay in the future. Together you and the bartender create an asset and a liability.
  You just created credit. Out of thin air. It's not until you pay the bar tab later that the asset and liability disappear, the debt goes away and the transaction is settled ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbvcskzz8y56jswrvhnj4ca2))
- Remember, in an economy without credit:
  the only way to increase your spending is to produce more. But in an economy with credit, you can also increase your spending by borrowing. As a result, an economy with credit has more spending and allows incomes to rise faster than productivity over the short run, but not over the long run ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbvct3rg84t8mrvmrzxgmxvr))
- When the amount of spending and incomes grow faster than the production of goods: prices rise. When prices rise, we call this inflation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbvcwysm54d27b7j0bk0jmtt))
- The Central Bank doesn't want too much inflation
  because it causes problems. Seeing prices rise, it raises interest rates. With higher interest rates, fewer people can afford to borrow money. And the cost of existing debts rises ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbvcy4qwcrv47th2jne10h7c))
- As you can see, the economy works like a machine. In the short term debt cycle, spending is constrained only by the willingness of lenders and borrowers to provide and receive credit. When credit is easily available, there's an economic expansion. When credit isn't easily available, there's a recession. And note that this cycle is controlled primarily by the central bank. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbvcyxc0megjcedxncs4tbk1))
- It's a boom! It pays to buy goods, services, and financial assets with borrowed money! When people do a lot of that, we call it a bubble. So even though debts have been growing, incomes have been growing nearly as fast to offset them. Let's call the ratio of debt-to-income the debt burden. So long as incomes continue to rise, the debt burden stays manageable ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbvd1zcxdb38fc3306vfh5gy))
- In a recession, lowering interest rates works to stimulate the borrowing. However, in a deleveraging, lowering interest rates doesn't work because interest rates are already low and soon hit 0% - so the stimulation ends ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbvd435yghz6jkgf28bgr9tv))
- The difference between a recession and a deleveraging is that in a deleveraging borrowers' debt burdens have simply gotten too big and can't be relieved by lowering interest rates ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbvd4n0ww8yrmgq8c62466ns))
- In a beautiful deleveraging, debts decline relative to income, real economic growth is positive, and inflation isn't a problem. It is achieved by having the right balance. The right balance requires a certain mix
  of cutting spending, reducing debt, transferring wealth and printing money so that economic and social stability can be maintained ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbvderpv8nek273cvwh4r54s))
- It takes roughly a decade or more for debt burdens to fall and economic activity to get back to normal
  - hence the term 'lost decade. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hbvdj3f9m5wsy3p6epq01fbk))
- First: Don't have debt rise faster than income, because your debt burdens will eventually crush you. Second: Don't have income rise faster than productivity, because you will eventually become uncompetitive. And third: Do all that you can to raise your productivity, because, in the long run, that's what matters most. This is simple advice for you and it's simple advice for policy makers.
