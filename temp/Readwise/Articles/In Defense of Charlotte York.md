# Highlights
- To emancipate woman is to refuse to confine her to the relations she bears to man, not to deny them to her; let her have her independent existence and she will continue none the less to exist for him also: mutually recognising each other as subject, each will yet remain for the other an other. The reciprocity of their relations will not do away with the miracles – desire, possession, love, dream, adventure – worked by the division of human beings into two separate categories; and the words that move us – giving, conquering, uniting – will not lose their meaning.

- In essence, what Charlotte needs to prove to him is that she is willing to play out the other half of their dynamic — the beloved — not out of a need to be loved, but out of a need to be loved by *him*. I see parallels here to a distinctly non-heterosexual form of butch-femme dynamics. (Maybe that’s too cynical. Maybe locating the erotic heart of this relationship I’ve idealized for so long outside of men is a form of heteropessimism.
