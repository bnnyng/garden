- Pelagius’s teaching, despite its empowering and optimistic appearance, was in practice far crueller than Augustine’s. If each person was capable of perfection, anything less was failure. It meant that a person had deliberately chosen evil. There could be no excuses for failing to live up to Christ’s example.
