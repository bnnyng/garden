# Highlights
- This stance abandons completely the illusion of equality with men and stresses the fact that we must know that *we ourselves* are the result of a shameful but inevitable negotiation with patriarchy, with the Law, and with other forces that structure our lives. There is no longer any “good side of the barricade,” because in this perspective, there are no barricades ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrbpnytq08jdn183j2f531bg))
## New highlights added March 20, 2024 at 7:31 AM
- This radical approach to autobiography is a form of “existential nudism,” a desire for truth at the limit of obscenity ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsbtfmjx3b4pcqn4cfk5bm5y))
    - Note: Definition of existential?
- Through the gesture of classifying women according to their libidinal metabolism, Lonzi brings forward the brutality of feminine sexual organs and their hidden connection to our political position. Talking about the orgasm means talking about the compromises that we are all ready to make in order to reach and preserve pleasure. That’s why it is vital for her to state that her journal of a feminist is also a journal of a clitoridian woman. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsbth12kp112g5nbk35ygm30))
    - Note: Relationship to the body's pleasures, image of the body makes me uncomfortable, almost disgusted...why? Is this what the powers want?
- The attempt to perform in all of these fields can only lead to schizophrenia and solitude: the dream of being a militant, an intellectual, an accomplished person, a mother, and a spouse appears as pathetic and dangerous ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsbthxtrf7fpc3fccpegvp51))
    - Note: Provides a model for subjectivizing oneself.
- In the preface to her journal, Lonzi gives her final word on the feminine skill of multitasking: “For me, doing one thing has a value because it prevents me from doing two. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsbt7cbh578razgphtkc4r2m))
    - Note: Interesting, is this pro or anti multitasking?
- men must just be “abandoned to themselves,” which in no way means that they should be avoided or treated like enemies. Abandoning men to themselves comes down to refusing to play into the mythology of a complementarity constructed entirely at the expense of women ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsbtne63k12y9ej4cpjfs9b8))
- The fact that women are objectified by patriarchal culture appears clearly in the difference between the destiny of adult men and adult women. Men create an attraction through their personality that gives an erotic halo even to their decay. Women realize brutally that the fading of their physical freshness awakens, in the best case, a form of tolerance that avoids or delays erotic exclusion. Men use myth, women don’t have sufficient personal resources to create it. Women who have tried to do so by themselves have endured such stress that their lives have been shortened by it ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsbtmy3rb0bzh3stcb6wh6qp))
- The ease with which she abandoned her intellectual privilege is puzzling when we measure the importance of her writing, but somehow it is totally coherent: she could only find power in her lack of attachment to writing as a cultural practice. In fact, her skepticism towards culture is the very source of her theoretical strength. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsbtsby78rxpwdehb255pmm1))
- Lonzi delivers her objections from the standpoint of the human relationship as a means without an end. She dangerously unmasks the demon of work and the gender struggle hidden inside love. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsbv4d4eqm21pt6emsbkp5yp))
    - Note: Interesting how her recording of the dialogue is also like the plot in the Anatomy of a Fall! While the movie leads to frustration on the part of the audience, attempt to compromise by the characters, this "real" person has embodied an almost unrealistic extreme. — Oh! In a later passage, the writer describes Lonzi's life itself as an artwork.
- They look for love and a relationship with a male partner, but this relationship will only take place in a way that reinforces the partner, helps him to face the world from a stronger position. A woman’s need for love was indeed created by patriarchy to help men succeed in life. Women give love an independent value, while men give it an instrumental one. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsbv7gc5r26d35ev8tkwhg7g))
- And then men,” she writes, “recuperate this love as an absolute value in the arts, in poetry, in the artworks that live and grow through these non-relationships. Therefore men, after preventing [women] from living love, offer to them its symbol as an object. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hsbv7tyy9dept5zth8033ner))
    - Note: Art at the expense of human relationships; in this case, can women make art?
