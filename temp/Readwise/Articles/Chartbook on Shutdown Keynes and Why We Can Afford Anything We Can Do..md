# Highlights
- The discovery of our financial freedom robs us of excuses. This is the hard political edge of the related schools of post-Keynesianism, functional finance and modern monetary theory. If we fail to do something, we should not blame lack of money. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdg38w4qmfwptt1kg7qfzw2e))
- In the actual doing, what counts is the recalcitrance of stuff and the recalcitrance of power. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hdg3ba3k7mz6910hfn1ce4dp))
- John Maynard Keynes is surely not the most radical critic of capitalist political economy.
