# Highlights
- So in linear regression, we have an activation function, which is an identity function.
  This is actually boring because this means the input that goes into this function also comes out of this function. So this is really just a placeholder function that returns the value Z at this point. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6vjf0tx04ag8xthp8x5web8))
- In logistic regression, the activation function is followed by a threshold function, as we will see in more detail later. So here's this logistic regression activation function, which is also called logistic sigmoid function. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6vjfqkcjqwftfpahfwnx3bm))
- In the case of the perceptron, we have an activation function that is a threshold function.
  So here the threshold function returns class table one, if the weighted sum is greater than zero, and otherwise it returns class label zero. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6vjffdsxk4r1ver89w1akm7))
