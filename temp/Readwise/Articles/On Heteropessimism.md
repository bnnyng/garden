# Highlights
- It doesn’t make sense to extricate your own straight experience from straightness as an institution—if you are embarrassed by one, you are necessarily embarrassed by the other. Heterosexuality is nobody’s personal problem. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hymhzn7d3ksfdbgyhr5zzmry))
- Heteropessimism consists of performative disaffiliations with heterosexuality, usually expressed in the form of regret, embarrassment, or hopelessness about straight experience. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hymj09xdz7hkyhf27cgq6mz9))
- That these disaffiliations are “performative” does not mean that they are insincere but rather that they are rarely accompanied by the actual abandonment of heterosexuality. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hymj046eytbb4gvzp8nzr28y))
