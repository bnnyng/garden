## Highlights
- You and I operate as human capital: an input in the process of social reproduction, rather than its master or even its goal. Much of our life from childhood onward is dedicated to proving our value within this paradigm ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hj34qhe91fkn2ymzbea15j3b))
- having children has become an inconvenient and inefficient trade-off ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hj34s3qkgyswa6njg6gmgawg))
- Unable to exist without its human substrate, yet also unable to sustain it, this technocratic paradigm has a fatal contradiction within it: despite its hegemony, it is incompatible with life. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hj34rwmmjjrtqt358p2hdm8q))
- As members of that element, you and I will only come out the other side by prioritizing our own success in biological and material terms over our usefulness to others as human capital ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hj34tyw6wk77jdqd50nd4g5p))
- When populations converge on a material and social paradigm of life that powers their expansion, history records it as the coming into being of a new people ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hj34wkzzaf6p5w525cpz0ma5))
    - Note: "Ethnogenesis"
- The range of a few hundred to a few thousand families is what makes up a collective in-group capable of real bonds, cooperation, and a sense of common destiny. This is the scale of a real community that can cohesively act on the world ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hj34yxd3safqnabjhgdjwmhm))
- Populations may rise and fall, but the scale of agency stays much the same: in a solar system where 100 billion humans span multiple worlds and moons, it will still be coordinated groups of thousands of people that drive history. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hj34z9mjwj2bfef95ncbfrrx))
- At their founding, the formal purpose of such governments was to pursue the common interests of those groups that had established them ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hj350b9qq6nzhj4qzcmr70y1))
- A state exists to handle the most general level of a community’s affairs, and doing this it all assumes that a defined community with a common purpose and interest actually exists ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hj3512xy1e86y5m94cd8whq1))
- Not only does the regime you live under not represent your fundamental interests, but many Western regimes have no such conscious in-group at all. They are either no longer in the hands of those who once established them, or else their current descendants have substantively ceased to identify with their own forebears. They are not even in the hands of a new people—no process of ethnogenesis is underway in Paris or Berlin. Rather all these people and structures have become fuel for the technocratic world. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hj3562dj5xepwt4md666zp3c))
- Your own biological existence and that of your lineage are tangible interests. So is the successful exploitation of a novel material niche, the continuity of a way of life, and the ability to pursue transcendent or spiritual goals ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hj356z1z6azmhwxgea7ap5r1))
- Modern states view their populations as human capital fully replaceable first by immigration, and then eventually by technology ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hj358pw9d417kem1dswkaa36))
- It is only with the people with whom you undertake these things that you can share political life ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hj358hkhzxesakj4qrt9m8ed))
- Implicit in the technocratic paradigm under which we live is the idea that something other than human beings could be the agents of history: technology, institutions, good legal mechanisms, labor relations, or even the post-human intelligence yearned for by Wells and by modern AI accelerationists. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hj3593yavy9gf516p4ev02vb))
- When Amish families do not prioritize the material niche necessitated by their fundamental spiritual mission, they lose their center of gravity and assimilation follows ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hj35cr4ew02xhr2ry5gpy20v))
- The collective consciousness that a form of life sustains is the most important thing your community shares. For your economic incentives to align with your social and biological ones, the work you do to secure material wealth should rely on the communal bonds formed under your collective consciousness as assets, not liabilities. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hj35eg6r3vqddccn767e508a))
- This also means that advanced society is dependent on an agency that is willing to construct it for some higher purpose. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hj35kjtas1ak7zs4hsn7r5h2))
    - Note: Really interesting... "everyone needs a religion" at a collective scale. Without higher purpose, no direction?
- The same holds true of the corporate structures that make up the social organization of modernity: the first global corporate structures were religious orders and charter companies that drew adventurers to the ends of the Earth. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hj35kt65sr3ecjah29q06mxv))
- Their foundations were laid on the same scale of action that all founding populations historically act on: thousands of people, not millions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hj368ctz0prat611kqkya054))
    - Note: Main thesis
- Our task at present is to identify those capable of this kind of action, and to enter into community with those who share our most tangible interests. It is only once we achieve a shared consciousness on these terms that a new “us” can exist, and with it the foundation for a new way of life.
