# Highlights
- to be an intelligent being is to be *embodied* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htfed46actpz6h1m5r8y530t))
- to be intelligent is to always be *situated* in a “context of significance” to which certain things belong and others specifically do not. It is only in this kind of practical context that particular objects can show up in the first place *as* tools or obstacles. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htfedm8em3hr5wjqzdrket07))
- This notion of “purpose” brings us to the final criterion, what Dreyfus simply refers to as *need*. Human purposes, needs and ends don’t exist prior to or somehow independently of either the bodies we are and have or the “situation”. It is rather those purposes that make *intentionality* – our capacity to direct our attention to particular objects and act in a self-directed way – first possible.

    - Note: Intention precedes action in the body and situation.
- Dreyfus draws a hard distinction between the biological body as a set of physiological mechanisms continuous with the rest of nature and the phenomenological body as the locus of experience and skilled coping. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htfejk72fg9ghdhc2517azzd))
- Yet if our purposive behaviour isn’t rule-bound in *some* sense, how is it generalisable beyond any particular situation? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htfej8wv025vyhkt47n8sey6))
