# Highlights
- The most abstract is the computational level, where we consider the problem that the system is solving and what an ideal solution to that problem looks like. If the underlying problem involves learning or inductive inference, then an ideal solution to that problem comes from Bayes’ rule – Bayesian models of cognition are defined at this level of analysis.

- Bayesian models of cognition are explicitly defined at the computational level. By contrast, accounts of human cognition based on artificial neural networks typically situate themselves at the algorithm or implementation levels, focusing on cognitive or neural processes rather than abstract problems and their ideal solution (e.g., McClelland et al., 2010).

- A Bayesian analysis suggests that how well this model performs will be influenced by the probability with which the required answer appears in the text used to train the model, and this prediction is borne out in some surprising ways that the model behaves even when solving deterministic problems (see Figure 4).

- a more explicit version of Bayesian models
  of cognition can be applied to AI systems. For example, Griffiths and Tenenbaum (2006) used a “predicting the future” task to explore human prior distributions for various everyday events. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hq965ewapt65fr0hts7e5gd3))
    - Note: Possible modeling project—find established result for humans, apply to LLMs to investigate inductive biases?
