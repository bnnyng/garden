# Highlights
- The sociologist Emile Durkheim separated suicides into four types: the egoistic, the altruistic, the anomic (moral confusion), and the fatalistic. Perhaps self-immolation captivates so thoroughly because it wins on all counts. It is the ultimate act of both despair and defiance, a symbol at once of resignation and heroic self-sacrifice.

- “Fire is the most dreaded of all forms of death,” he said, so “the sight of someone setting themselves on fire is simultaneously an assertion of intolerability and, frankly, of moral superiority. You say ‘I would never have the guts to do that. It’s not that he’s trying to tell me something, but that he’s *commanding* me.’ This isn’t insanity. It’s a terrible act of reason.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqmh61dezymdmnmm62trm3je))
- But while his suicide was intensely personal, it was interpreted as an act of public defiance. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqmh6qk17mk9xmvv03azh9ch))
    - Note: What does it say about culture, mass media now Aaron Bushnell will be represented as the opposite?
