# Highlights
- The first cultural device was probably a recipient ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyst6xym98hek7e3k06r44rj))
- with or before the tool that forces energy outward, we made the tool that brings energy home. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyst8vd9fw2m09txzp85rzdh))
- ("What Freud mistook for her lack of civilization is woman's lack of loyalty to civilization," Lillian Smith observed.) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hystamy1t9p659hpwyea3ndm))
    - Note: What is this gender essentialism? Women like baskets and not sticks?
- Wanting to be human too, I sought for evidence that I was; but if that's what it took, to make a weapon and kill with it, then evidently I was
  either extremely defective as a human being, or not human at all. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hystaes0bqnv84xcb874j8v7))
- if to do that is human, if that's what it takes, then I am a human being after all. Fully, freely, gladly, for the first time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hysteccbgwk5fk3qgmx1dca2))
- The novel is a fundamentally unheroic kind of story. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hystnv1f5nkdeh5vk37q2j4k))
    - Note: Why is the Hero story defaulted to? If novels are naturally bags, why include this concession to the Hero's dominance?
- A book holds words. Words hold things. They bear meanings. A novel is a medicine bundle, holding things in a particular, powerful relation to one another and to us. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hystnj3xbnqbdehav5tsv1a5))
- its purpose is neither resolution nor stasis but continuing process. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hystrpp8rrn5rtj4c7y9s3d3))
    - Note: The purpose of narrative.
- "Technology," or "modern science" (using the words as they are usually used, in an unexamined shorthand standing for the "hard" sciences and high technology founded upon continuous economic growth), is a heroic undertaking, Herculean, Promethean, conceived as triumph, hence ultimately as tragedy. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hystvp3mrtsna3cpq7v55vj0))
    - Note: Such interesting nuance!
- redefines technology and science as primarily cultural carrier bag rather than weapon of domination, one pleasant side effect is that science fiction can be seen as a far less rigid, narrow field, not necessarily Promethean or apocalyptic at all, and in fact less a mythological genre than a realistic one.

    - Note: How Le Guin writes good science fiction? Is this a prescriptive world view or just an explanation of product?
