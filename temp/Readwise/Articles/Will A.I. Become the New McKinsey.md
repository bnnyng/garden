# Highlights
- The point of the Midas parable is that greed will destroy you, and that the pursuit of wealth will cost you everything that is truly important. If your reading of the parable is that, when you are granted a wish by the gods, you should phrase your wish very, very carefully, then you have missed the point.

- A former McKinsey employee has described the company as “[capital’s willing executioners](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2019/02/mckinsey-company-capitals-willing-executioners#:~:text=An%20insider's%20perspective%20on%20how,spreads%20the%20gospel%20of%20capitalism%E2%80%A6&text=The%20author%20of%20this%20piece%20has%20chosen%20to%20maintain%20anonymity.)”: if you want something done but don’t want to get your hands dirty, McKinsey will do it for you. That escape from accountability is one of the most valuable services that management consultancies provide. Bosses have certain goals, but don’t want to be blamed for doing what’s necessary to achieve those goals; by hiring consultants, management can say that they were just following independent, expert advice.

- So, in the context of this discussion, whenever I criticize capitalism, I’m not criticizing the idea of selling things; I’m criticizing the idea that people who have lots of money get to wield power over people who actually work. And, more specifically, I’m criticizing the ever-growing concentration of wealth among an ever-smaller number of people, which may or may not be an intrinsic property of capitalism but which absolutely characterizes capitalism as it is practiced today.

- Some might say that it’s not the job of A.I. to oppose capitalism. That may be true, but it’s not the job of A.I. to strengthen capitalism, either. Yet that is what it currently does. If we cannot come up with ways for A.I. to reduce the concentration of wealth, then I’d say it’s hard to argue that A.I. is a neutral technology, let alone a beneficial one.

- There are a lot of different versions of accelerationism, but the common thread uniting left-wing accelerationists is the notion that the only way to make things better is to make things worse. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h94ttv79tmebpd35axs9hdx8))
- Accelerationism says that it’s futile to try to oppose or reform capitalism; instead, we have to exacerbate capitalism’s worst tendencies until the entire system breaks down. The only way to move beyond capitalism is to stomp on the gas pedal of neoliberalism until the engine explodes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h94ttztm0ct7h63jhvzcht0c))
- Capitalism is the machine that will do whatever it takes to prevent us from turning it off, and the most successful weapon in its arsenal has been its campaign to prevent us from considering any alternatives. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h94tx62ff53nkqn9hzmz0ds3))
- If you try to criticize capitalism, you are accused of opposing both technology and progress. But what does progress even mean, if it doesn’t include better lives for people who work? What is the point of greater efficiency, if the money being saved isn’t going anywhere except into shareholders’ bank accounts? We should all strive to be Luddites, because we should all be more concerned with economic justice than with increasing the private accumulation of capital. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h94v12wh9pztqjep3feaepxb))
- Whenever anyone accuses anyone else of being a Luddite, it’s worth asking, is the person being accused actually against technology? Or are they in favor of economic justice? And is the person making the accusation actually in favor of improving people’s lives? Or are they just trying to increase the private accumulation of capital?

- In 1976, the workers at the Lucas Aerospace Corporation in Birmingham, England, were facing layoffs because of cuts in defense spending. In response, the shop stewards produced a document known as the Lucas Plan, which described a hundred and fifty “socially useful products,” ranging from dialysis machines to wind turbines and hybrid engines for cars, that the workforce could build with its existing skills and equipment rather than being laid off. The management at Lucas Aerospace rejected the proposal, but it remains a notable modern example of workers trying to steer capitalism in a more human direction. Surely something similar must be possible with modern computing technology. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h94vh9950qd67739myym4wq0))
- They say it’s a world-changing technology. If that’s the case, then they have a duty to find ways for A.I. to make the world better without first making it worse. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hj242rwk0xw5wj22e5xd6mqg))
- The tendency to think of A.I. as a magical problem solver is indicative of a desire to avoid the hard work that building a better world requires. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hj23w9c65g5e2h9824wqcwbz))
- For technologists, the hardest work of all—the task that they most want to avoid—will be questioning the assumption that more technology is always better, and the belief that they can continue with business as usual and everything will simply work itself out.
