# Highlights
- But philosophers share the general human weakness for explanations of what is incomprehensible in terms suited for what is familiar and well understood, though entirely different. This has led to the acceptance of implausible accounts of the mental largely because they would permit familiar kinds of reduction.

    - Note: Abstract thought/higher cognition is made possible through metaphor?
- we have at present no conception of what an explanation of the physical nature of a men- tal phenomenon would be. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hysx5p1mv7tdeqh25nwkza4q))
- fundamentally an organism has conscious mental states if and only if there is something that it is like to be that organism—something it is like for the organism. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hysx70y92y2w9xyqee0ajfgt))
    - Note: BIG main idea! Nagel calls this the "subjective character of experience."
- Without some idea, therefore, of what the subjective character of experience is, we cannot know what is required of a physicalist theory. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hysxag9eedsxkt2qer1wg0xp))
- subjective phenomenon is essentially connected with a single point of view, and it seems inevitable that an objective, physical theory will abandon that point of view. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hysxfge4b08hv9sjr1nyyw9c))
    - Note: Problem with a physical theory of mind.
- behave as a bat behaves. But that is not the question. I want to know what it is like for a bat to be a bat. Yet if I try to imagine this, I am restricted to the resources of my own mind, and those resources are inadequate to the task.

    - Note: But what if the physical structures are utilized differently? Different patterns of neural firing to process the sensory experiences? Would that not be a physical explanation?
- My realism about the subjective domain in all its forms implies a belief in the existence of facts beyond the reach of human concepts. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hysxsyd230npefcvsf2nka4p))
- Reflection on what it is like to be a bat seems to lead us, therefore, to the conclu- sion that there are facts that do not consist in the truth of propositions expressible in a human language. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hysxzjb26pe5qrfyj7r870j1))
- There is a sense in which phe- nomenological facts are perfectly objec- tive: one person can know or say of another what the quality of the other’s experience is. They are subjective, however, in the sense that even this objective ascription of experi- ence is possible only for someone sufficiently similar to the object of ascription to be able to adopt his point of view—to understand the ascription in the first person as well as in the third, so to speak.

- mind-body problem ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hysykv5p61k1nts1z09exdfk))
    - Note: I.e. how is consciousness related to the physical brain? The physical brain can be understood objectively, by different points of view!
- par excellence ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hysy6ga5p1bm4xsps1k4d54w))
    - Note: "Above all," exceptional in a representative way.
- objectivity as a direction in which the understanding can travel. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hysyz850c7dmhpe2m0s7cj7q))
- It is difficult to understand what could be meant by the objective character of an experience, apart from the particular point of view from which its subject apprehends it. After all, what would be left of what it was like to be a bat if one removed the viewpoint of the bat? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hysz0dgfwxbw2fjrja9p6vpp))
- In other areas the process of reduction is a move in the direction of greater objectivity, toward a more accurate view of the real nature of things. This is accomplished by reducing our dependence on individual or species-specific points of view toward the object of investigation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hysz36pm9q5w74xh7b2nkvwz))
- their more particular viewpoints are not part of the common reality that they both apprehend. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hytd1b9drhk4hxv1561cdj85))
- If we acknowledge that a physical theory of mind must account for the subjective char- acter of experience, we must admit that no presently available conception gives us a clue how this could be done. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hytd61m0r5zzwrjabm8cmjrg))
    - Note: Again, main critique.
- If mental processes are indeed phys- ical processes, then there is something it is like, intrinsically,11 to undergo certain phys- ical processes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hytd74w0bbgab9rjyfhhwdn8))
- physicalism is a position we cannot understand because we do not at present have any conception of how it might be true. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hytd7sckbyctebb008gyf0ag))
- physicalism ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hytd8ph44dsjabzn98vg5q83))
- At the present time the status of physical- ism is similar to that which the hypothesis that matter is energy would have had if uttered by a pre-Socratic philosopher. We do not have the beginnings of a conception of how it might be true. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hytdb56bgsq1p43sxat2jhhd))
    - Note: Repeating himself, clearly the central claim against physicalism.
- At present we are completely unequipped to think about the subjective character of experience without relying on the imagination—without taking up the point of view of the experiential sub- ject. This should be regarded as a challenge to form new concepts and devise a new method— an objective phenomenology not dependent on empathy or the imagination. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hytpqtd73bmqpaz8jjy48fn9))
    - Note: Is this still a relevant project?
- it seems unlikely that any physical theory of mind can be contemplated until more thought has been given to the general problem of subjec- tive and objective. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hytppzc1e131mvar2g2zk6f6))
