# Highlights
- If industry really wants to help scale and advance computer science research, it’s easy to do. Do what many companies are already doing, but do much more of it. Give fellowships to graduate students and scholarships to undergraduate students. Employ students as interns. Pay for named chairs and new buildings. Give lots of faculty small amounts of research money. Make and publish open datasets. Give us easy access to industrial scale computing resources. But don’t raid our faculty and tell us it’s good for us. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrnmtrqeh65jwn671p01y8d6))
