# Highlights
- What’s striking here is not Solanas’s revolutionary extremism per se, but the flippancy with which she justifies it. Life under male supremacy isn’t oppressive, exploitative, or unjust: it’s just fucking boring. For Solanas, an aspiring playwright, politics begins with an aesthetic judgment.

- If men were wise, they would seek to become really female, would do intensive biological research that would lead to men, by means of operations on the brain and nervous system, being able to be transformed in psyche, as well as body, into women. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hybkknvyd65r89mwpdgfbxt1))
- Here, transition, like revolution, was recast in aesthetic terms, as if transsexual women decided to transition, not to “confirm” some kind of innate gender identity, but because being a man is stupid and boring. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hybkmpwpk2y9m88vf9qg2c30))
- The truth is, if it’s hard for contemporary readers to tell men and trans women apart in Solanas’s analysis, it is not because she thinks all trans women are men; if anything, it’s because she thinks all men are closeted trans women.

- “the ‘emotion’ of great historiographic form”—that is, the satisfaction of synthesizing the messy empirical data of the past into an elegant historical arc in which everything that happened could not have happened otherwise.

    - Note: The "tapestry of qualifiers"
- all cultural things, SCUM Manifesto included, are answering machines for history’s messages at best only secondarily. They are rather, first and foremost, occasions for people to feel something ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hybxa6y3qtpf1e7sr2jsbevk))
- They also don’t much like the name TERF, which they take to be a slur—a grievance that would be beneath contempt if it weren’t also true, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hybxdg35byxzthzd3764a6a4))
    - Note: "All bywords for bigots are defamatory" is an interesting point! Yes...and? Rather than denial of slur.
- The actual problem with an epithet like TERF is its historiographic sleight of hand: namely, the erroneous implication that all TERFs are holdouts who missed the third wave, old-school radical feminists who never learned any better. This permits their being read as a kind of living anachronism through which the past can be discerned, much as European anthropologists imagined so-called primitive societies to be an earlier stage of civilizational development caught in amber.

    - Note: Interesting perspective! Underestimates the movement.
- When a subculture espouses extremist politics, especially online, it is tempting but often incorrect to take those politics for that subculture’s beating heart. It’s worth considering whether TERFs, like certain strains of the alt-right, might be defined less by their political ideology (however noxious) and more by a complex, frankly fascinating relationship to trolling, on which it will be for future anthropologists, having solved the problem of digital ethnography, to elaborate.

- feminist transphobia was not so much an expression of anti-trans animus as it was an indirect, even peripheral repercussion of a much larger crisis in the women’s liberation movement over how people should go about feeling political. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hybxt5cdqyvk5qtf5s8psdc4))
- then feminist revolution could only be achieved by combing constantly through the fibrils of one’s consciousness for every last trace of male supremacy ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hybxtg36c9z9cqx4f37a8n82))
- trans-exclusionary feminism has inherited political lesbianism’s dread of desire’s ungovernability. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyfjnwjfer2cvfs8zvafq1n6))
- political lesbianism was intended as a solution to the all-too-real cognitive dissonance produced by heterosexual feminism: “Why go to all these meetings where you’re creating all this wonderful theory and politics, and then you go home to, in my case, Dave, and you’re sitting there, you know, in front of the telly, and thinking, ‘It’s *weird*. This feels *weird*.’” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyfjp6s6d74xe63zgqwe82t0))
- Political lesbianism is founded on the belief that even desire becomes pliable at high enough temperatures. For Jeffreys and her comrades, lesbianism was not an innate identity, but an act of political will. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyfjpxy6gyxwb7gg3502pscv))
- true lesson of political lesbianism as a failed project: that nothing good comes of forcing desire to conform to political principle. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyfjt8mm66xjbmy3hk1rdmfg))
- matter not of who one *is*, but of what one *wants*. The primary function of gender identity as a political concept—and, increasingly, a legal one—is to bracket, if not to totally deny, the role of desire in the thing we call gender. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyfjv90dt9y1hxxdz8pw7vw4))
- the state has been far more willing to recognize sex reclassification when the reclassified individuals don’t get anything out of it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyfjyefge45snjp1er94z4cq))
- That’s the basic paradox of aesthetic judgments: they are, simultaneously, subjective and universal. Transsexual women don’t want bottom surgery because their personal opinion is that a vagina would look or feel better than a penis. Transsexual women want bottom surgery because *most women have vaginas.* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyfk2qdd8vp44nwa8wj17pp2))
- To admit that what makes women like me transsexual is not identity but desire is to admit just how much of transition takes place in the waiting rooms of wanting things ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyfk7jtb5f9y8kz4s4bag2m7))
- You don’t want something because wanting it will lead to getting it. You want it because you want it. This is the zero-order disappointment that structures all desire and makes it possible. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyfk62mkdqm2rr5enafxb4ez))
- The other name for disappointment, after all, is love. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyfk6gdnw5g7bt4gr81kqaq8))
