# Highlights
- “The only truly linguistic things we’ve ever encountered are things that have minds. And so when we encounter something that looks like it’s doing language the way we do language, all of our priors get pulled in, and we think, ‘Oh, this is clearly a minded thing.’” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz9kjr2ft7hmxb8mmfefz79a))
- We tend to think that beings that can “do language” are intelligent: we ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz9kjfgp3mfy0h8pgq3hr28g))
- meaning was differential—the meaning of each word depends on that of other words. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz9kkxd8mkpcywq5awrzw7ta))
- Newer AI models boast this capacity to amalgamate into the ostensibly new—and it is precisely why they are called “generative.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz9kvqjrhx54se8b52fqbwzf))
- The mysticism of AI isn’t a hidden or inscrutable mind behind the curtain; it’s to do with scale and brute power. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz9kx2pwv9spmjf018he01x8))
- . When we use our intelligence to craft solutions to economic crises or to tackle racism, we do so out of a sense of morality, of obligation to those around us, our progeny—our cultivated sense that we have a responsibility to make things better in specific, morally significant ways.

    - Note: Interesting! Beyond physical embodiment, but physical in the sense that you have something at stake with your PHYSICAL existence. Is morality necessarily embodied?
- This is what the utopian vision of the future so often misses: if and when change happens, the questions at play will be about if and how certain technology gets distributed, deployed, taken up. It will be about how governments decide to allocate resources, how the interests of various parties affected will be balanced, how an idea is sold and promulgated, and more. It will, in short, be about political will, resources, and the contest between competing ideologies and interests. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz9m8fz10m49j3k01wpkvv8v))
    - Note: But what about the argument that AI will outsmart the general will to serve its own purposes? Resources = embodiment, every algorithm needs a physical implementation.
- the promise of AI lies in dealing with sets of data that exist at a scale humans simply cannot operate at. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz9md8g0r96bjax0axprhxrp))
- We are awash with digital detritus, and in response, we seek out a superhuman assistant to draw out what is true. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz9mdnjq9pe02n3zqdwwc244))
- We arrive at moral evaluations not through logical puzzles but through consideration of what is irreducible in us: subjectivity, dignity, interiority, desire—all the things AI doesn’t have. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz9me2aa12kz9mn4m5dnjm5r))
- To say that AI on its own will be able to produce art misunderstands why we turn to the aesthetic in the first place. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz9medb2qwtapfy1rt7kjace))
    - Note: Similar to the requirement that mathematical proofs be comprehensible to humans.
- It’s the assumption that AI is in fact intelligent that causes us to outsource an array of social and political functions to computer software—it’s not just the tech itself which becomes integrated into day-to-day life but also the particular logic and ethos of tech and its libertarian-capitalist ideology. The question is then: to what ends AI is deployed, in what context, and with what boundaries. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz9mk777sx4q1pxv4n9vj9y1))
- To humans awash with a sea of subjectivity, AI represents the transcendent thing: the impossibly logical mind that can tell us the truth. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz9mr39jc17q3t7ndgja2a9f))
