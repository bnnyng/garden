# Highlights
- Yet, is his dignity of decision in fact nothing more than a bracketing of the world and the other, an act of subjective violence, a decisionism expressing some collectivist *zeitgeist*? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hp6fc5ep5130y73fr5q2cge2))
- Moreover, is the notion that existence precedes essence the same as beginning with the subjective? Is this not already an essence, and one that has been determined by a historically established philosophy (Descartes)? If we begin in this way, are we not already proceeding in the manner of production, as with a formula or technique? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hp6fcxyck76d09b4eckx2489))
- *Quietism*, contemplative, incapable of action (Communist) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hp7fxvh815jyrv2ygh46d0cr))
- The human, who lives his or her subjective life, projects him/herself into the future, he/she is this projection of purposes, and ‘before that projection of the self, nothing exists’. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hp6h8mnmhd0qcmtmfhzzsqdz))
- Returning, in a certain sense, to the ethical universalisation of the Kantian categorical imperative, Sartre states that as we freely choose for ourselves, we are, at once, choosing for all humankind. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hp6hagp7fn44k3zqyyv7w8xs))
- since nothing precedes the choice to give us guidance on that which we are or ought to be, the choice itself bestows value upon that which is chosen, upon the image that is projected as what the human ‘ought to be’. Sartre states, ‘In fashioning myself, I fashion man’ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hp6hbfgm1vs4dt6zar7y713n))
- the first principle of existentialism – that the human makes him/herself, and to its first effect, that the human is solely responsible for him/herself. Since the human has nothing to rest upon and no recourse to either a divine or a human nature, ‘man is free, man is freedom’. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hp6hh8akfzjvnm1xqtdgvj0f))
- Despair entails, for Sartre, that we remain within the realm of possibilities and probabilities and, in this context, must limit ourselves to that which is within the capacity of our wills and that which is concerned with our own action ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hp7ft6ngk7v1m9q332tjz7br))
- It is interesting that Sartre eventually became a Communist. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hp7fvqjpw7vfb6tqvza74njr))
- He states that far from being a quietism, existentialism holds that ‘there is no reality except in action ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hp7fwzthf96av9mqh7qje5ee))
    - Note: Quietism is contemplation without action
- Sartre declares that the point of departure for his philosophy is in the Cartesian cogito (‘I think’), which he characterises as the ‘absolute truth of consciousness as it attains to itself.’ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hp7g1hfzxdpdd5549n8fv5f4))
- it grounds the otherwise probabilistic state of affairs which is the situation in which the subject finds itself ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hp7g210h01n4ewv3z79gnsdk))
    - Note: Why is this state problematic? Compared to everything Bayesian lol
- Is this a coherent position? Can I speak of a subjectivity and as an ‘immediate presence of one’s self’, as the ‘absolute truth of consciousness as it attains to itself’, if another is required as a mediator, as a witness? Or, is this attainment, as self-consciousness, a form of collective consciousness, as with Marx’s notion of class consciousness? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hp7g4qb4n3ksen8e8nt8yga3))
- being is subjectivity conceived as the universal subjectivity of the human reality. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hp7g783xg4hvq78deva5zpgm))
- There is no human nature, for Sartre, there is no essence before our existence. There is nothing before we exist, and our only essence comes from our own commitment, our own acts, our own invention of ourselves – in other words, from our own freedom.
